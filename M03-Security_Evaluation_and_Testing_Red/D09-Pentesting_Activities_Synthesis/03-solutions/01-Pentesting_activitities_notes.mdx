# TA Brief: Afternoon Session - Report Finalization & Housekeeping

**Module:** Mid-Training Report Finalization  
**Focus:** Ensuring High-Quality Deliverables & Clean Workspace

This brief helps you, the Teaching Assistant (TA), guide students through the afternoon dedicated to finalizing their reportsâ€”covering technical pentest findings, governance/risk results (ISO 27001, EBIOS RM, BIA), and preparing their workspace for the next phases of training.

## Overview and Objectives

- **High-Quality Reports:**  
  Students should produce polished, well-structured documents that clearly communicate vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, risk scenarios, and business impact considerations.

- **Integration of GRC Insights:**  
  Encourage students to link technical issues with ISO 27001 controls, EBIOS RM risk assessments, and BIA findings to give their recommendations broader context.

- **Clean Workspace:**  
  Students will remove outdated files, sensitive test data, and ensure their environment is organized and secure for upcoming modules.

## Afternoon Schedule

- **13:30 - 13:45: Introduction & Guidance**
    - Recap the goals: finish and refine all reports, integrate GRC insights, and tidy up.
    - Emphasize professionalism and the importance of final deliverables.

- **13:45 - 16:00: Report Refinement & Quality Assurance**
    - Students work on refining technical and GRC-related reports:
        - Add missing details, improve clarity.
        - Enhance evidence quality (screenshots, references).
        - Ensure recommendations are actionable and aligned with standards.
    - TA Role: Offer feedback on clarity, coherence, and best practice alignment.

- **16:00 - 16:10: Break**

- **16:10 - 17:30: Workspace Cleanup & Final Touches**
    - Students remove temporary data, old logs, and sensitive credentials.
    - Organize notes and project files for future use.
    - TA Role: Advise on secure deletion methods and organizational strategies.

- **17:30 - 17:45: Q&A, Group Discussion, and Feedback**
    - Students may share their refined reports for quick feedback.
    - TA Role: Encourage peer review, highlight outstanding examples, and answer final questions.

- **17:45 - 18:00: Daily Recap and Closing**
    - Summarize accomplishments.
    - TA Role: Remind students that their reports should now be client-ready and their environment fully prepared for upcoming training segments.

## TA Responsibilities

### During Report Refinement

- **Encourage Integration of GRC Findings:**  
  Suggest ways to connect technical vulnerabilities with ISO 27001 controls, EBIOS RM risk evaluation, and BIA findings, making recommendations more holistic.

- **Promote Consistency & Clarity:**  
  If reports vary in style, push for standardization. Ensure all findings have root cause, impact, and remediation steps clearly defined.

- **Offer Technical & Compliance Clarifications:**  
  Help students understand how to reference specific ISO 27001 clauses or how to incorporate EBIOS RM risk scenarios into their recommendations.

### During Cleanup

- **Support Secure Deletion & Organization:**  
  Advise on best practices for removing sensitive data and suggest folder structures or note-taking methods for efficiency in future sessions.

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Overly Generic Recommendations:**  
  Prompt students to specify exact tools, frameworks, or hardening measures rather than vague advice.

- **Inconsistent Integration of GRC Elements:**  
  If GRC insights are missing, remind them to mention relevant ISO 27001 controls or reference EBIOS RM steps and BIA outcomes to strengthen the context of their findings.

- **Low-Quality Evidence:**  
  Suggest retaking screenshots at higher resolution, annotating them, or adding clear captions.

## Additional Tips

- **Professional Mindset:**  
  Reinforce that these deliverables simulate real-world reporting. High standards now translate into valuable career skills.

- **Time Management:**  
  Encourage students to allocate time wisely. If stuck on one detail, move to another report or start the cleanup process, then return later.

- **Positive Reinforcement:**  
  Commend thoroughness, clarity, and strong integration of GRC considerations. Highlight the importance of combining technical and governance insights.

By providing guidance in this finalization and housekeeping afternoon session, you help students elevate their work to professional standards, ensuring all reports are polished, aligned with best practices, and ready for hypothetical client presentation.
