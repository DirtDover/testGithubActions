- Advices on how to ace a pentest report

## Professional writing techniques

It's time to write the pentest report. You've received several tips before, but they bear repeating, so we'll cover the essentials here and offer some advice for better writing.

### On the form

First, **determine who will read the report**. Keeping the audience in mind is crucial. This helps you decide on things like "Should I explain the consequences of an SQL injection more clearly?"

Always **use the present tense**. Your report addresses current vulnerabilities, not past ones.

**Never write in the first person** (I); always use the collective (we). This is often true in most cases and also adds credibility in the eyes of the client.

**Avoid the passive voice**. It's better to use two active sentences than one passive sentence. Give yourself a limit of two tokens to spend on passive voice in the entire report. Reserve them for situations where you absolutely have no other choice. For instance, use _"Microsoft has recommended disabling SMBv1 since 2016."_ instead of _"It is recommended to disable SMBv1."_.

**Don't write long, eloquent sentences**. We're doing technical writing. Be direct and to the point. There's no need for poetry; we want to deliver information quickly, clearly, and unambiguously. Use precise words. If a word seems too technical, explain it to ensure everyone understands (this is also where knowing your audience helps in making these choices).

**Do not hesitate to make repetitions**. Do not try to find synonyms for the same word. If you're talking about a "vulnerability," use "vulnerability" every time. This helps the reader understand the context. The report is technical, not a novel.

**Add captions to your screenshots and figures**. It helps explain what's happening in the image.

For each vulnerability, you can follow a plan like the one below:

| **Report Section**                        | **Content to Include**                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability Title**                   | A clear and concise title that contextualises the found vulnerability.                                                                                                |
| **Vulnerability Description**             | A high-level summary of the vulnerability, including an explanation of the potential impact if successfully exploited.                                                |
| **Affected Component**                    | Specific details of the affected element, such as a URL or parameter, to pinpoint where the vulnerability exists in the system.                                       |
| **Proof of Concept (Steps to Reproduce)** | Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, with screenshots or videos if necessary, so anyone can understand and replicate the issue.                             |
| **Criticality**                           | - **Impact**: The effect of the vulnerability on operations, rated from Low to Very High.<br /> - **Likelihood**: Probability of exploitation, from Low to Very High. |
| **Exploitation Complexity**               | Description of the complexity of exploiting the vulnerability and the conditions required for successful exploitation (optional).                                     |
| **Overall Severity** or **CVSS Score**    | Evaluation of the overall severity based on impact and likelihood or scale from 0 to 10, helping to prioritise the vulnerability in the remediation plan.             |
| **Suggested Fixes (Remediations)**        | Specific and detailed solutions to fix the vulnerability, using imperative commands like "Install", "Update", etc.                                                    |

### Writing tips

Sometimes, the fear of the blank page can hit hard. Even with consolidated facts and notes, you might not know where to start. The first thing to understand is that writing is an iterative process. You'll write something first, which will lead to another idea, then you'll revisit and refine it, and so on. Writing feeds on writing.

**The hardest part is to start**. Take your report and **begin writing whatever comes to mind**. Throw down the words without worrying about spelling, typos, or structure. **Just write**.

Once you have your first draft, **read and rewrite** it in sections. You'll find that not everything needs to be discarded, and the bulk of the work will be done.

Learn to use Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Äì a [local LLM with Ollama](https://ollama.com/), ChatGPT, Mistral, Gemini, and others, effectively. No, they are not sources of truth. However, they excel at generating text from existing text with modifications. Use them to:

- switch from passive to active voice,
- change the tone of a text to be more serious,
- clarify certain passages,
- or summarise content.

<Note type="warning">

Of course, **never** disclose your client's information to a private LLM service (like ChatGPT, etc.). Only do so with their explicit consent ‚Äì but that's rare. It's best to use a local LLM or none at all.

</Note>

Review the outputs from LLMs carefully and validate what you like. They can also help combat writer‚Äôs block by providing prompts, transitions, and so on.

We‚Äôre not writing literature. You won‚Äôt be judged for generating text with an LLM, but rather for how effectively the client can use your report. Don‚Äôt hesitate!

Here's a personal tip: if you know Vim and multimodal editors, go ahead and **use a multimodal editor**. It‚Äôs fantastic for writing! It requires some learning, but in the long run, you‚Äôll benefit from navigating text using only your keyboard.

## Presenting facts

Presenting facts is like martial arts. It takes training and patience to reach mastery. But with the advice from my old master, you'll gain exceptional skills.

First, you need to remember that a fact is: **objectively true, has actually happened, and can be verified**. For example, do not say _"The server was running an unsupported version of Nginx."_ but rather _"The HTTP response headers indicated an unsupported version of Nginx."_ which is a fact.

Presenting facts involves **sharing the screenshots** you gathered during the pentest.

It's not about showcasing a gallery of your best exploits; it's about **presenting 3 to 5 screenshots** per vulnerability to support your findings. Try to stick to this range. Fewer than three might not be enough (unless no screenshots are needed), and more than five could be excessive (unless absolutely necessary).

How to take good screenshots? My master always said **it's better to capture the entire screen at max resolution** and **crop the relevant part later**. This gives you more flexibility.

Also, my master always **emphasized using red boxes** because red draws attention. Don‚Äôt hesitate to adjust the border thickness. It should be visible without obscuring the context.

Some screenshots might need a caption. **The caption provides context**, like if it‚Äôs a special render or from a specific tool.

Lastly, here‚Äôs my master's well-kept secret: **no transparent backgrounds on terminals**! And no fan-service wallpapers either. Sorry.

## Tips

Here are some tips to help you structure and write an impactful report.

### How to Judge the Quality of the Report?

You judge the quality of a report by the fact that **the client doesn't ask questions**. This means everything is clear and understandable. That's our goal.

### Don't Get Too Attached to Your Work

Writing a report is a team effort. It's an iterative process involving back-and-forth communication between team members, especially with the manager. Don‚Äôt take criticism of your work personally. **These are critiques of your work, not your ability to do good work.**

This can be challenging for juniors. So, view critiques as opportunities to improve, better understand the objectives of your work, and progress.

### Know Your Tools

We don‚Äôt know which tools you use, but spending some time exploring them might reveal interesting and irreplaceable features once mastered!

For example, did you know Word allows you to [add comments](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-modern-comments-in-word-edc6ae71-0a2d-49fe-8faa-986f1e48136a)? Simple. But did you also know you can **[get notified](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-notified-when-members-of-your-team-update-your-shared-file-9cc94893-02d5-4d96-9b3f-8b9414d5047a?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) when a new comment is posted**? BOOM! Extremely useful for being responsive when deadlines are tight.
