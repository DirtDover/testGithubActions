# Presentation

## What you will learn in this course üßêüßê

- Learn to make a physical presentation of your pentest results
- Adopt the right posture and attitude when facing the client

The presentation is the critical moment. It's the **culmination of your mission**. Prepare thoroughly and be ready on the big day to ensure you don't miss this opportunity to impress the client.

Follow these tips to increase your chances of success.

## Preparation

A few days before the presentation, **read through the entire report again**. Often, you will have moved on to other missions (maybe several), so it's important to refresh your memory.

Ensure that all team members attending the presentation have also read the entire report.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to **explain the vulnerabilities to each other**. This helps you understand those you didn‚Äôt discover yourself. Remember, a client can always ask you questions even if you're not the one presenting, so it's better to be prepared than to stumble over a poor response.

## The big day

It's time to present your work to the clients.

First, ensure you have the **right number of people compared to the client**. If the client is represented by two people, don't show up with five. Match the client's number of attendees, give or take one person.

If the client arrives with a large team, it indicates the mission's importance to them. Gather your entire team who worked on the project to be present and show your commitment to the client, even if you've already moved on to other missions.

Okay, we're ready! The first thing to do is **present the report introduction**. Place your work in the context of the company (why did they commission this mission?).

Then, give a **summary of the discovered vulnerabilities** so non-technical attendees get an overall view of the report. Provide the pentest results, the conclusion, right from the start.

Next, **detail the vulnerabilities** in your own words while **maintaining a professional tone and attitude**. Use the screenshots taken during the mission to illustrate your points and explain the potential consequences of your findings.

During the presentation and especially afterwards, the client will have questions. **Adopt an open and friendly posture**, but be firm on certain points.

Sometimes, the client might try to shift the focus, for instance, by asking you to retake screenshots. You know perfectly well that retaking screenshots would take an extra half-day to reproduce the exploit. That's not feasible. You can respond that, no, you can't retake the screenshots, but you can see if there are better ones in your existing collection or add more screenshots to enhance understanding.

Facing the client can be challenging. Only observation and practice will help you adopt the right posture and find the right words.

Congratulations, you‚Äôve just completed your first presentation!

**Listen to feedback and ask for comments** from your manager and colleagues. **Confronting criticism is the only way to improve** in this discipline.
