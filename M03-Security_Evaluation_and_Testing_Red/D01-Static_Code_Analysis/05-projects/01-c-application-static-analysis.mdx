## Mission Objective

IBC relies on an internal application, written in C, to manage client accounts, execute transactions, and generate reports. Your job is to review the provided source code, identify potential security vulnerabilities, and propose fixes to strengthen the application. This is the first step in a broader security audit that Corellia will be conducting for IBC.

## What you need to do

- **Conduct a full code review**: Analyze the codebase thoroughly. Identify any potential security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to memory management issues, input validation problems, and other weaknesses common in C applications.
- **Document the vulnerabilities**: For each vulnerability you identify, describe the problem and its potential impact on the security of the application.
- **Propose solutions**: Suggest fixes to address each issue, ensuring the application is secure and operates as intended.
- **Submit your findings**: At the end of the mission, you will need to submit a report detailing the vulnerabilities you discovered and the corrective actions proposed.

## Deliverables

- A report listing all identified vulnerabilities and proposed recommendations.

This mission is critical to ensuring that IBC's banking operations remain secure and protected from potential cyber threats. It will serve as a foundation for the additional security measures that Corellia will implement as part of the broader contract with IBC.

Good luck on your first mission with IBC!
