## TA Responsibilities

### During the Code Review Exercise

1. Prompt Critical Thinking:  
   Encourage students to question assumptions:

   - Is this input sanitized?
   - Could this pointer operation cause a buffer overflow?
   - Are credentials handled securely?

2. Provide Contextual Clues:  
   Without giving direct answers, guide them towards considering compliance requirements (like IBC’s internal policies), secure handling of PII, and proper encryption.

3. Encourage Thoroughness:  
   Students might focus on obvious issues (e.g., hard-coded passwords). Remind them to consider less obvious vulnerabilities (e.g., logging sensitive data off-site without encryption, weak cryptographic methods).

4. Offer Industry References:  
   Point them to OWASP guidelines, ISO 27001 clauses, or known best practices in secure coding. This helps them understand the rationale behind certain recommendations.

### During the Documentation and Remediation Phase

- Clarify Technical Concepts:  
  If students struggle to understand why a certain vulnerability is dangerous (e.g., a race condition in balance updates), explain using simple analogies.

- Guide Solution Brainstorming:  
  Help students propose realistic fixes: switching to prepared statements for SQL queries, implementing proper input validation functions, using environment variables for credentials, employing proven encryption libraries, or introducing access control checks for large transactions.

- Encourage Structured Reporting:  
  Students should present their findings in a clear, concise manner, linking each vulnerability to an impact and a recommended solution. Provide examples of well-structured vulnerability descriptions.

### General Support

- Monitor Progress:  
  Keep an eye on students who appear stuck or lack direction. Gently prompt them with questions that lead them toward discovery, rather than just giving away answers.

- Promote Collaboration:  
  Encourage students to discuss their findings with peers. Group brainstorming can reveal hidden vulnerabilities and more robust solutions.

- Answer Questions Promptly and Clearly:  
  Provide explanations that are concrete and use analogies where possible. Avoid overly technical jargon if students appear confused.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Students Not Knowing Where to Start:  
  Suggest they begin with one file at a time, looking for suspicious functions (e.g., `strcpy`, `sprintf` without bounds) or input-handling logic. Encourage scanning for `TODO` or commented code that might indicate a known weakness.

- Difficulty Understanding a Vulnerability’s Impact:  
  Ask them to think of a real attacker’s goals: Could someone read sensitive data? Modify transaction amounts? Crash the system?

- Proposed Solutions Too Vague:  
  Challenge students to be specific. Instead of “Use better input validation,” ask them to propose a concrete function or library call. Instead of “Encrypt data,” have them name a recognized encryption standard or approach.

- Time Management:  
  If students spend too long on one issue, remind them there may be multiple vulnerabilities to find. Encourage them to move on and return later if they have time.

## Additional Tips

- Highlight Real-World Relevance:  
  Remind students that the skills they’re building—code review, vulnerability analysis, secure coding—are crucial in professional cybersecurity roles.

- Be Patient and Encouraging:  
  Students have varying skill levels. Reinforce that finding any vulnerability is progress and that over time, they’ll become faster and more accurate.

- Foster Independence:  
  While assisting, ensure students still learn how to reason about vulnerabilities on their own. Give hints rather than direct answers, so they gain confidence in their analytical abilities.

# Solution: Static Analysis

Below is a detailed summary of all the vulnerabilities that were present in the code. Each entry notes the type of vulnerability, where it was found.

## Overview

In the code, several classes of vulnerabilities and issues were identified:

1. **Hard-Coded Credentials & Excessive Privileges**
2. **SQL Injection via Unvalidated Input**
3. **Buffer Overflows & Insecure Memory Handling**
4. **Weak or No Input Validation**
5. **Format String Vulnerabilities**
6. **Use-After-Free and Memory Mismanagement**
7. **Weak "Encryption" and Mismanagement of Sensitive Data**
8. **Business Logic Flaws (No Approval for Large Transactions)**
9. **Concurrency / Race Conditions in Transaction Updates**
10. **Logging Sensitive Data in Plaintext**
11. **Non-Compliance with Internal Policies (IBC_SEC_POLICY)**
