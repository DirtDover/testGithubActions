# Penetration Testing IBC's REST API for the News Platform

<Note type="tip">

You can use the [Jedha CLI](https://app.jedha.co/track/learn-to-use-the-jedha-cli) to start the lab:

```bash
jedha-cli start ibc-news
```

## Context

IBC has requested a full security audit of their public-facing **news platform’s REST API**. During a recent briefing, you gathered critical information about an API used by IBC. This API underpins their online news portal, providing endpoints for article listings, user comments, writer profiles, and content management. Although less sensitive than financial data, the integrity and authenticity of IBC’s news content is crucial to maintaining the organization’s reputation and public trust.

The client believes that a secure news platform is essential to prevent unauthorized content modifications, misinformation, or abuse of user comment functionalities. Your role is to identify any vulnerabilities that could compromise article integrity, user data confidentiality, or the platform’s availability.

## Consultant's Notes

- **Target:** A RESTful API serving a news website.
- **Functionality:**
  - Displaying articles.
  - Managing user-generated content (e.g., comments on news articles).
  - Handling writer profiles, including the ability to post or edit articles.

## Task

Your objective is to discover vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data or compromise the system’s integrity. During this test, you will need to focus on various potential issues, including:

- **Broken Access Control:** Can unauthorized users access draft articles or edit published content?
- **Authentication & Authorization Issues:** Are login endpoints secure? Can session tokens be reused or stolen?
- **Data Exposure:** Are user details, writer profiles, or article drafts leaked through misconfigured endpoints?
- **Injection Attacks:** Could malicious input (e.g., SQL/NoSQL injection in search parameters or XSS in comments) alter database content or inject scripts?
- **Rate Limiting & Input Validation:** Does the API prevent brute-force attacks against login endpoints or large-scale scraping of article data?

Prepare a detailed report highlighting your findings, including proof of concept for each discovered vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and recommended fixes.

Your findings will guide IBC in strengthening their API’s security posture, ensuring that the news platform remains trustworthy, authentic, and safe from manipulation. Be thorough, maintain professional rigor, and prioritize vulnerabilities by their potential business impact.
