# Web Application Penetration Test for IBC

<Note type="tip">

You can use the [Jedha CLI](https://app.jedha.co/track/learn-to-use-the-jedha-cli) to start the lab:

```bash
jedha-cli start ibc-web-app
```

## Context

As part of the contract signed with IBC, you have been tasked with conducting a real-world penetration test on their online banking application. This test aims to ensure the security of their platform, which handles sensitive customer information and processes financial transactions. The application plays a crucial role in the operations of IBC, and the client has emphasized the importance of discovering vulnerabilities to prevent potential exploitation.

## Consultant's Notes

- **Target**: Web-based banking portal.
- **User Roles**: Customers, Admins.
- The application allows clients to:
  - Create and manage accounts.
  - Initiate and monitor transactions.
  - Modify user settings (e.g., passwords, contact details).
- **Tech Stack**:
- Backend & Fronted: .NET
- Authentication system: weak session verification.
- No known security audit performed before.
- **User Roles:**
  - **Customers:** Can register accounts, update their profiles, view balances, and initiate transactions.
  - **Administrators:** Manage the system, user accounts, and have elevated privileges.

## Task

Your task is to perform a penetration test on this banking web application. Focus on identifying vulnerabilities listed in the **OWASP Top 10**. You should carefully examine the systemâ€™s endpoints, user roles, and input validation mechanisms to uncover security weaknesses.

You will use a combination of manual testing and automated tools to:

- Identify common vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Broken Authentication**.
- Analyze how sensitive information, such as user data and transaction details, is handled.
- Investigate potential misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.

Prepare a detailed report highlighting your findings, including proof of concept for each discovered vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and recommended fixes.

## Areas of Exploration

1. **Access Control & Authentication:**  
   Investigate if you can access protected endpoints without proper credentials. Check if user session management is robust. Consider what happens if you remove session cookies or manipulate session tokens.

2. **Data Handling & Validation:**  
   Examine where user input is accepted (search fields, forms, file uploads, API endpoints) and see if the application correctly sanitizes or validates it. Consider injection attacks (SQLi), script injection (XSS), and other forms of input manipulation.

3. **Cryptographic Practices & Sensitive Data Exposure:**  
   Assess how passwords and sensitive transaction details are stored or transmitted. Determine if encryption or hashing is used correctly. Look for opportunities to expose sensitive information (e.g., balances, personal data) that should remain confidential.

4. **Business Logic & Flaw Exploitation:**  
   Explore whether you can bypass key steps in workflows, such as approving large transactions without the required permissions. Check for misconfigurations or "hidden" functionalities that allow unauthorized actions.

5. **Server & Configuration Issues:**  
   Identify any server misconfigurations, outdated components, or default settings that could lead to breaches. Consider how error messages, stack traces, or commented-out code might leak sensitive details about the internal structure.
