# Cloud Infrastructure Pentest for IBC

## Context

IBC has recently performed a Proof of Concept (PoC) with the three major cloud providers—AWS, GCP, and Azure—for a blog post on their digital transformation journey. As part of their continued effort to strengthen security, they require a real-world pentest of their cloud infrastructure across these platforms. The goal of this pentest is to test a sample of the infrastructure to assess whether best practices are being followed for securing cloud environments.

## Consultant's Notes

- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, Azure.
- **Components**:
- Virtual machines (EC2, Compute Engine, Azure VMs).
- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions).
- Managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure SQL).
- Object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage).
- **Goal**: Find cloud-specific misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access or data leakage, and assess whether best practices are followed.
- **Concerns**:
- Misconfigured permissions or IAM roles.
- Overly permissive storage buckets or databases.
- Serverless misconfigurations leading to privilege escalation.
- Vulnerabilities in network configurations (e.g., exposed services, misconfigured firewalls).
- Lack of proper logging or monitoring of cloud activity.

## Task

Your task is to conduct a pentest of IBC’s multi-cloud infrastructure, focusing on AWS, GCP, and Azure. The test will focus on a sample of the infrastructure components to evaluate whether cloud security best practices are being followed, especially in key areas like access control, resource configuration, and data protection.

You will be expected to:

- Evaluate the security of virtual machines, serverless functions, and managed databases.
- Check for any misconfigurations in storage permissions that could lead to data exposure.
- Investigate potential privilege escalation pathways within the serverless architectures.
- Assess the security of network configurations, ensuring that no unnecessary services are exposed publicly.
- Ensure that logging and monitoring are properly implemented across the infrastructure for incident detection.

Produce a detailed report of your findings, including the vulnerabilities discovered, steps to reproduce, and recommendations for securing IBC’s cloud infrastructure, with an emphasis on adhering to industry best practices.
