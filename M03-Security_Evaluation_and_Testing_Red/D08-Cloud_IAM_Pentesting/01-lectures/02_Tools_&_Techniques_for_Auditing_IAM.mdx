- Understand how to conduct an IAM audit effectively
- Learn about common IAM audit tools and techniques

## PrepWork for IAM Audit

When we talk about IAM (Identity and Access Management), we refer to a set of rules, tools, and practices for managing digital identities and controlling access to resources. We can't perform a traditional pentest on the entire IAM framework itself. Instead, we can conduct an audit to analyze and verify all configurations and policies in place. This differs from a pentest, which focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in specific tools, systems, networks, or applications. Additionally, it's crucial not to forget to request access to the various services, software, and other resources to effectively carry out the pentest.

Conducting an IAM audit becomes even more challenging when an organization has multiple, highly restrictive business controls in place. These controls can complicate the process of accessing and reviewing IAM configurations and policies, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire system. In such cases, auditors must navigate through these layered controls to ensure that all aspects of the IAM framework are thoroughly examined. An IAM audit examines whether the IAM configurations comply with best practices and security standards, while a pentest aims to exploit weaknesses to test the system's defenses.

### Planning Audit

To plan an IAM audit effectively, start by **clearly defining its scope and objectives**. Determine the specific IAM components that will be evaluated, such as user provisioning, access controls, and compliance with regulatory standards. Establishing clear objectives will guide the audit process and help identify key areas for improvement, such as uncovering security vulnerabilities or verifying the effectiveness of existing policies.

Next, **gather all relevant information**, including IAM policies, procedures, user access logs, and system configurations. This involves a thorough documentation review to ensure that the audit is based on comprehensive and accurate data. Additionally, conduct interviews with key stakeholders, such as IT staff, system administrators, and business unit leaders, to gain insights into current IAM practices and any potential issues.

You can now **develop a detailed audit**. Create a checklist based on industry best practices and standards like [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) or [ISO 27001](https://advisera.com/27001academy/what-is-iso-27001/), outlining specific controls and processes to be reviewed. Establish a timeline for the audit and allocate the necessary resources, including personnel and tools, to ensure the audit can be conducted efficiently and effectively.

Before the audit begins, **notify relevant departments and individuals** about its scope and objectives. This ensures that everyone is prepared and understands the importance of the audit. Arrange access to the necessary systems, documentation, and personnel for the audit team. Additionally, brief the audit team on the specific IAM systems and processes they will be evaluating to ensure they are well-prepared for the task.

### Definition of Objectives and Targets

Clearly defining objectives and targets is essential for a successful IAM audit. The primary objective is to **evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the IAM framework** within the organization. This involves several specific goals:

First, the audit aims to **assess the security posture of the IAM system**, ensuring it adequately protects against unauthorized access and data breaches. This includes evaluating the strength of authentication methods, the robustness of access controls, and the management of privileged accounts.

Secondly, the audit should ensure compliance with **relevant regulatory requirements** and industry standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001. This involves verifying that IAM practices meet legal obligations and identifying any areas of non-compliance that need to be addressed.

Another key objective is to **identify vulnerabilities within the IAM setup**. This involves examining configurations, policies, and practices to uncover any weaknesses that could be exploited by internal or external threats. The audit should also evaluate existing IAM policies and procedures to ensure they are comprehensive, up-to-date, and effectively implemented across the organization.

Additionally, **improving operational efficiency is a critical target**. The audit should identify areas where IAM processes can be streamlined or automated to enhance efficiency and reduce administrative overhead. This may involve assessing the tools and technologies used for user provisioning, de-provisioning, and access management.

**Enhancing the user experience** is another important objective. The IAM system should provide a seamless and secure experience for users, minimizing disruptions while maintaining strong security controls.

## IAM Audit Tools

### Common tools

The main objective of the IAM audit is to gather as much information as possible about the permissions of the various users and the configurations in place. There are several ways of gathering this information. The two best-known methods are currently Amazon's IAM Access Analyzer and Microsoft's analysis of these logs using various tools.

#### AWS IAM Access Analyzer

[AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/iam/access-analyzer/) is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyze AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Its main purpose is to detect overly permissive access permissions and potential vulnerabilities in IAM configurations.

In an audit context, IAM Access Analyzer is crucial because it helps identify and mitigate unintended or excessive permissions that could pose security risks. For example, it can flag IAM policies that allow broader access than necessary, potentially exposing sensitive resources to unauthorized access.

By using IAM Access Analyzer, audit teams can pinpoint IAM policy errors and misconfigurations that violate security best practices. This includes scenarios where permissions are inadvertently granted to users or roles, or where policies are outdated and no longer reflect current security requirements.

Overall, IAM Access Analyzer strengthens security and compliance efforts by ensuring that IAM policies align with organizational security policies and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.

Here is some example of how to use AWS IAM:

- Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API to create an analyzer. This tool will scan your AWS resources and generate findings.

```bash
aws accessanalyzer create-analyzer --analyzer-name my-analyzer --type ACCOUNT
```

- Retrieve findings to identify potential security risks.

```bash
aws accessanalyzer list-findings --analyzer-name my-analyzer
```

- Findings can be exported for further analysis.

```bash
aws accessanalyzer get-finding --analyzer-name my-analyzer --id finding-id
```

#### Azure AD logs

**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) logs** serve as a fundamental source of telemetry data for monitoring and auditing activities within Azure AD environments. These logs capture a wide range of events related to user authentication, access management, application usage, and directory changes, providing granular insights that are essential for security auditing and compliance assessments.

In the context of auditing, Azure AD logs enable detailed analysis of activities such as:

1. **Sign-ins and Authentication**: Logs record successful and failed sign-in attempts, including details such as the user's IP address, device platform, and authentication method used (e.g., password, multi-factor authentication).

2. **User and Group Management**: Changes to user accounts, group memberships, and role assignments are logged, helping auditors track modifications that could impact security posture or compliance status.

3. **Application Access**: Events related to application usage and permissions granted through Azure AD, such as access requests and grants, provide visibility into how applications are being accessed and managed.

4. **Security and Compliance Events**: Logs include security-related events such as suspicious sign-ins, risky authentication attempts, and policy violations, facilitating proactive detection and response to potential threats.

From a technical perspective, Azure AD logs are typically collected using Azure Monitor, which aggregates log data from various Azure services into a central repository. Auditors can then utilize tools like Azure Sentinel or third-party SIEM solutions to analyze these logs, correlate events across different Azure AD tenants, and create customized dashboards and reports.

Here are some example of what you can do with Azure AD:

- Use the AzureAD module to connect to Azure AD and retrieve sign-in logs.

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD
Get-AzureADAuditSignInLogs | Select-Object UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, SignInDateTime, Status
```

This command connects to Azure AD and retrieves sign-in logs, displaying the user principal name, application name, sign-in time, and status.

- Similarly, you can retrieve audit logs to monitor changes in the directory.

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD
Get-AzureADAuditDirectoryLogs | Select-Object ActivityDisplayName, InitiatedBy, ActivityDateTime
```

This command fetches audit logs, showing the activity name, who initiated it, and the time it occurred.

- Export the retrieved logs to a CSV file for further analysis.

```powershell
Get-AzureADAuditSignInLogs | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Path\To\Export\SignInLogs.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

This command exports the sign-in logs to a CSV file, which can be opened in Excel or other data analysis tools for detailed examination.

In addition to leveraging Azure AD logs for auditing purposes, organizations can optimize their monitoring and response capabilities with differents tools:

[**Microsoft Defender for Identity**](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/security/business/microsoft-entra) (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Advanced Threat Protection or Microsoft Defender for Identity). This service provides enhanced detection and investigation of advanced threats targeting identities on-premises and in the cloud. By integrating Azure AD logs with Microsoft Defender for Identity, auditors gain deeper insights into identity-related security incidents, such as suspicious activities, lateral movement attempts, and privilege escalation within Azure AD environments. This integration enhances the overall security posture by enabling proactive threat detection and rapid incident response, thereby strengthening compliance efforts and safeguarding organizational assets effectively.

[Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) serves as a pivotal tool for enhancing monitoring and response capabilities within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environments. Azure Monitor facilitates the collection and analysis of telemetry data, including Azure AD logs, to provide real-time visibility into critical activities such as user sign-ins, authentication events, and changes to permissions. This enables auditors and security teams to detect anomalies and suspicious behavior promptly. By leveraging Azure Monitor's custom query capabilities, organizations can perform in-depth analysis of Azure AD logs tailored to their specific auditing needs, ensuring thorough examination of security incidents and compliance violations. Furthermore, Azure Monitor integrates seamlessly with Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM solution, enabling advanced correlation of security events across Azure AD and other Azure services. This integration enhances proactive threat detection and facilitates rapid incident response, bolstering overall security posture and regulatory compliance efforts effectively within Azure AD environments.

## IAM Audit Techniques (Theoretical)

### Review of Permissions and Access

The first and most crucial step in conducting an IAM audit is to thoroughly review all permissions and access granted to various users. Unauthorized access to sensitive commands or files can be the most damaging aspect of a cyber attack, facilitating privilege escalation or causing irreparable harm even with minimal access. Identifying and rectifying these vulnerabilities is paramount.

In addition to reviewing permissions, it's essential to enforce strong password policies, including the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security. Password policies should require complex passwords, regular updates, and restrictions on reuse. MFA ensures that even if a password is compromised, an additional form of verification is required to gain access.

Implementing tools and processes that regularly review and update permissions, along with enforcing robust password policies based on the principle of least privilege, is critical to ensuring that users have only the access necessary to perform their job functions while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Analysis of Logs

After reviewing permissions, it's essential to analyze logs to identify any oversights, such as old user accounts or outdated software permissions. Logs can reveal actions that shouldn't be possible, indicating either an ongoing cyber attack or a significant flaw that requires immediate attention. By regularly analyzing logs, organizations can detect and mitigate risks proactively. Employing log management solutions, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, can automate this process, offering real-time monitoring and alerts for suspicious activities.

### Identification of Inactive Accounts and Unnecessary Access

Once all access points are identified, the next step is to verify the legitimacy of these accesses. Permissions that are inappropriate from a cybersecurity standpoint should be addressed. For instance, a secretary having access to a complete customer database is a potential security risk. Solutions to mitigate such risks include:

- Limiting access to necessary information only (e.g., first and last names).
- Encrypting sensitive files and using internal decryption tools for authorized personnel.
- Anonymizing customer data using identifiers or other methods.

However, it's crucial to strike a balance between security and employee efficiency. The ideal approach respects the three key principles of cybersecurity: Availability, Integrity, and Confidentiality. Ensuring that security measures do not hinder productivity is essential for maintaining a functional and secure environment. Regularly auditing and managing access rights, possibly using tools like automated IAM solutions, can help maintain this balance effectively.

## Audit Execution (practical)

### Data Collection

Before diving into the details of IAM system audits, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the initial steps of data collection. The process begins with **dumping the data**, which involves extracting comprehensive information from the IAM system using automated tools. This step is essential for gathering all relevant data, including audit logs, permission lists, and security alerts, which provides a foundation for thorough analysis.

Once the data is dumped, **analyzing** it becomes the next critical phase. This involves scrutinizing the collected data to identify potential vulnerabilities and verify that configurations are correctly implemented. Automated tools such as **AWS IAM Access Analyzer** and **Azure Monitor** are instrumental in this process, offering real-time insights and facilitating the discovery of potential issues.

Automated tools play a crucial role in efficiently capturing and providing initial insights into the IAM system's activities and configurations. They are particularly useful for large-scale environments where manual inspection alone might not be feasible.

However, despite the efficiency of automated tools, manual investigation is still indispensable. This step focuses on areas that automated tools might miss. For instance, auditors need to manually review **configuration files** such as IAM policy documents and access control settings to ensure permissions are correctly configured and aligned with security policies. Additionally, **access reviews** are conducted to analyze IAM role assignments and permissions, ensuring they meet business requirements and best practices. This includes checking access logs and user entitlements to detect any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

### Policy Analysis

#### Reviewing IAM policies

These policies, typically written in JSON or YAML, define the permissions for different roles or identities. It is essential to verify that these policies are correctly structured and adhere to the **principle of least privilege**. This means users should only have the access necessary to perform their duties. Overly permissive policies can create significant security risks.

#### Segregation of duties

This involves ensuring that no single user or role has control over all critical system functions, which helps prevent fraud and errors. The analysis should include cross-checking policy assignments to ensure that critical functions are appropriately divided among different users or roles.

#### Compliance alignment

IAM policies must meet the requirements of regulatory frameworks like **GDPR, HIPAA, or SOX**. During the analysis, it‚Äôs important to map IAM policies against these standards, ensuring they enforce necessary protocols such as data encryption and regular access reviews. Identifying and addressing any gaps in compliance is vital to reducing risks.

#### Policy simulation and testing

Simulating the effects of policy changes in a controlled environment can reveal potential issues, such as unintended access grants or denials. Tools like **AWS IAM Policy Simulator** or **Azure Policy** help automate and visualize these tests, ensuring that policies function as intended without conflicts or redundancies.

### Identifying Gaps and Vulnerabilities

The final stage of our audit, once we've collected all these vulnerabilities, is to identify the actions that can be taken through them. Is to identify the actions that can be taken by these vulnerabilities in order to check whether or not it is possible to go even further. This can be done in several ways and can have several levels of criticality.

During an IAM audit, a number of potential risks can be identified and exacerbated by flaws in identity and access management. One of the major risks is privilege escalation. Auditors carefully examine the permissions granted to users and roles, seeking to determine whether these exceed the real needs of their responsibilities. An excessively permissive permissions policy may allow a malicious user or external actor to acquire greater privileges, thereby compromising the overall security of the system.

Auditors also focus on detecting misconfigurations. Misconfigured policies or faulty access controls can leave the system vulnerable to unauthorised access or data breaches. For example, misconfiguration could allow a user to read, modify or delete sensitive data without proper authorisation, resulting in data leakage or financial loss.

Another critical aspect is the examination of inactive accounts. Auditors identify and analyse accounts that have not been used for some time but still retain access privileges. These inactive accounts can become easy targets for attacks, as they are often forgotten and less monitored. The presence of such accounts increases the risk of unauthorised use, especially if they have sensitive access. Disabling or deleting these accounts considerably reduces the potential attack surface.

## Analysis and Reports

### Interpretation of Audit Results

This step involves a detailed analysis of permissions, roles, and security policies to identify anomalies and deviations from best practices and security standards.

For example, **excessive permissions** granted to a user such as admin-level access to sensitive data without a business need can pose a significant risk, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure or system manipulation. Similarly, **over-permissive IAM roles** that allow users to escalate privileges or access resources beyond their job requirements can facilitate privilege escalation attacks, where an attacker gains higher access levels than intended.

**Unrestricted access** to critical systems or data from external networks due to misconfigured policies or security groups can also be a severe vulnerability. This might allow unauthorized users or attackers to exploit the system from outside the organization‚Äôs firewall. Another example is **inadequate role separation**, where a single user or role has conflicting permissions that violate the principle of segregation of duties. This can lead to issues like fraud or data tampering if sensitive tasks are not properly separated among different users.

By identifying these and other vulnerabilities, auditors can assess their potential impact based on the organization's specific context and provide a clear, accurate view of the risks.

### Recommendations and Prioritisation of Corrective Actions

After interpreting the results, the next essential step is formulating recommendations and prioritizing corrective actions. Recommendations should be practical, specific, and tailored to the organization's needs. They may include measures such as reducing excessive privileges, correcting misconfigurations, or implementing regular reviews of accounts and permissions. Prioritizing corrective actions is determined by the severity of the identified risks and their potential impact on the organization's security. For example, risks related to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive data should be addressed first. A structured and prioritized approach ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities are dealt with promptly, leading to a rapid and significant improvement in security posture.

### Drafting of Audit Reports

The final step in the process is drafting the audit report, which should accurately reflect the audit findings, analyses conducted, and recommendations made. The report should be clear, concise, and structured in a way that is easily understandable by various stakeholders, including technical teams and management. It should include a summary of key findings, a detailed description of identified flaws, and a list of recommended corrective actions with their prioritization. Additionally, it is helpful to include technical appendices to provide extra details for those who need them. The final report should not only document the issues but also serve as a roadmap for future improvements, thereby strengthening the identity and access management security within the organization.

Auditing IAM is a comprehensive profession in itself, requiring a deep understanding of various technical, organizational, and security aspects. It is not a skill that can be fully mastered in a single day. However, our goal here is to provide you with an initial introduction, offering foundational knowledge and insights that will serve as a starting point for further learning and development in this critical field.
