# Advanced Pentesting Web (Part 2)

## What you will learn in this course üßêüßê

- Let's explore more advanced web penetration testing techniques!

In this second part of our exploration into advanced web application attacks, we delve into some of the most insidious and impactful vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of web systems. These advanced attacks target specific weaknesses in how applications handle files, authenticate users, process requests, and manage data. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for developers, security professionals, and anyone responsible for securing web applications against the most determined adversaries.

We will explore the following advanced attacks:

- **Directory Traversal & File Inclusion:** Techniques that allow attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope of the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or execution of malicious scripts.
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** A vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes internal implementation objects, such as files or database records, directly to users, allowing them to manipulate these references to gain unauthorized access.

- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Vulnerabilities:** Issues related to the use of JSON Web Tokens, which, when improperly implemented, can lead to authentication bypass, information leakage, or token tampering.

- **Advanced SQL Injection:** More sophisticated methods of exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities that go beyond basic attacks, allowing attackers to execute complex queries, extract vast amounts of data, or even gain administrative control of the database.

- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attack where the attacker tricks the server into making HTTP requests to an unintended location, often resulting in unauthorized access to internal systems or the disclosure of sensitive information.

- **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection):** A vulnerability that occurs when user input is embedded within server-side templates, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

- **Advanced XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Techniques that exploit weaknesses in the handling of user input to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or malware distribution.

- **Business Logic Errors:** Subtle flaws in the way an application processes user actions or transactions, allowing attackers to manipulate workflows to their advantage, often in ways that are difficult to detect through conventional security testing.
