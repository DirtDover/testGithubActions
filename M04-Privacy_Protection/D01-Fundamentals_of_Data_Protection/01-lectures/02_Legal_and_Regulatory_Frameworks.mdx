# Legal and Regulatory Frameworks

Understanding the **legal and regulatory frameworks** governing data protection is essential for navigating the complex landscape of data privacy. These frameworks not only establish the rules and guidelines for handling personal data but also ensure that individuals' rights are safeguarded against misuse. At the heart of this regulatory environment is the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, which sets the standard for data protection across the European Union and beyond.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR can be considered as the world's strongest set of data protection rules, which enhance how people can access information about them and places limits on what organisations can do with personal data. The [full text of GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1552662547490&uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679) is an unwieldy beast, which contains 99 individual articles.

The regulation exists as a framework for laws across the continent and replaced the [previous 1995 data protection directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML). The GDPR's final form came about after more than four years of discussion and negotiations. It was adopted by both the European Parliament and European Council in April 2016.

GDPR came into force on May 25, 2018. Countries within Europe were given the ability to make their own small changes to suit their own needs. Within the UK this flexibility led to the creation of the [Data Protection Act (2018)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted), which superseded the previous 1998 Data Protection Act.

The strength of GDPR has seen it lauded as a progressive approach to how people's personal data should be handled and comparisons have been made with the subsequent [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://www.wired.com/story/ccpa-guide-california-privacy-law-takes-effect/).

### Objectives and Scope of the GDPR

The GDPR has three main objectives. Firstly, it** strengthens individual rights** by giving people greater control over their personal data, introducing new rights like data portability and the right to be forgotten. Secondly, it harmonises data protection laws across all EU member states, ensuring consistent rules by being directly applicable without the need for national legislation. Lastly, it places strict obligations on organisations that handle personal data, whether they act as data controllers or processors.

The General Data Protection Regulation broadly applies to all automated personal data processing and, in some cases, to manual processing as well. It covers any personal data processing linked to the EU, whether the entity handling the data is based within the EU or an entity outside the EU offers goods, services, or monitors the behaviour of people within the Union.

It also applies to all types of operations and activities involving personal data processing, regardless of who is doing the processing. This includes companies, associations, organisations, authorities, and private individuals. However, there are some exemptions. For instance, it does not apply to personal data processing by private individuals for purely personal or household activities. It also doesn’t cover situations where data processing is carried out in connection with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression or freedom of information.

### Key Articles and Obligations for Businesses

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes a series of obligations on businesses to ensure the protection of personal data. Adherence to these regulations is critical for maintaining data security and upholding individuals' rights. Below is a comprehensive overview of the principal articles and obligations businesses must follow under the GDPR.

#### Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

[Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) of the GDPR establishes the core principles for **lawful**, **fair**, and **transparent** processing of personal data. This principle is essential, as it mandates that businesses conduct all data processing activities in a way that honors individuals' **rights** and **expectations**.

**Lawfulness** requires that the processing of personal data be based on one of the legal grounds specified in the GDPR, such as **consent**, **contractual necessity**, or **compliance with legal obligations**.

In addition, **fairness** and **transparency** dictate that data subjects must be clearly and comprehensively informed about how their data is **collected**, **used**, and **stored**. This ensures that individuals understand and can exercise control over their personal information.

#### Data Subject Rights

Businesses must uphold and facilitate the rights of individuals regarding their personal data. These rights are essential for empowering individuals and ensuring they have control over their data:

- **Right of Access ([Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/))**: Individuals have the right to know whether their personal data is being processed and to access that data, along with any relevant supplementary information.
- **Right to Rectification ([Article 16](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-16-gdpr/))**: Individuals can request corrections to their personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete, ensuring that their information remains correct and reliable.
- **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten) ([Article 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/))**: Under certain conditions, individuals can request the deletion of their personal data, particularly when the data is no longer necessary or when they withdraw consent.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing ([Article 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-18-gdpr/))**: In specific situations, individuals can request that the processing of their data be restricted, limiting the ways in which their data can be used.
- **Right to Data Portability ([Article 20](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/))**: Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transfer it to another data controller.
- **Right to Object ([Article 21](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/))**: Individuals can object to the processing of their data on legitimate grounds, particularly in cases of direct marketing or processing based on legitimate interests.

#### Data Security

[Article 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) of the GDPR mandates that businesses establish **technical** and **organizational measures** that align with the level of **risk** to ensure data security. This article underscores the critical need for safeguarding personal data from threats such as **unauthorized access**, **accidental loss**, or **destruction**. Businesses are encouraged to employ techniques like **pseudonymization** and **encryption** as a means to protect data effectively. Furthermore, systems and services that handle personal data must maintain high standards of **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**, ensuring they can withstand and recover from incidents. In the event of physical or technical disruptions, businesses should have the capability to **restore data access** and **availability** without delay. To guarantee continuous protection, the effectiveness of these security measures must be **regularly tested**, **assessed**, and **evaluated**.

#### Data Breach Notification

[Article 33](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/) mandates that businesses notify the relevant supervisory authority (such as the CNIL in France) of any personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, those affected must also be informed without undue delay.

#### Record of Processing Activities

Under [Article 30](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/), businesses are required to maintain a record of their processing activities. This record should include details such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of data processed, the recipients of the data, and the security measures in place. Maintaining this record is essential for demonstrating compliance with the GDPR.

#### Appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO)

Certain businesses must appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) under [Articles 37-39](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-37-gdpr/), particularly if they **process data on a large scale** as a core activity, especially if it involves regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects. Or **Handling special categories** of data or data related to criminal convictions and offenses on a large scale. Or even they are a public authority or body, excluding courts acting in their judicial capacity. The DPO's role is to oversee data protection strategies and ensure compliance with the GDPR.

#### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

[Article 35](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/) requires businesses to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) whenever processing activities are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. The DPIA must assess the origin, nature, particularity, and severity of these risks, and identify measures to mitigate them.

#### Consent

[Article 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) clarifies that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Businesses must be able to demonstrate that individuals have consented to the processing of their personal data, ensuring that consent is obtained and managed in compliance with the GDPR.

### Data Processing Activities

The GDPR applies to all processing of personal data, whether automated or manual, as long as the data is stored or intended to be stored in a filing system. Processing includes activities such as collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storing, adapting, altering, retrieving, consulting, using, disclosing by transmission, disseminating, making available, aligning, combining, restricting, erasing, or destroying personal data.

#### Data Collection

Data collection involves gathering personal data from individuals or third parties, such as retailers, financial institutions, or marketing companies. For example, a customer might input their credit card details to make a purchase, someone might provide their email to enter a competition or join a mailing list, or a marketing company might share analytics data with you.

To collect personal data in compliance with GDPR’s Article 5, you must obtain consent before gathering the data and only collect the minimum amount necessary for your purposes.

Dont forget to publish a Privacy Policy on your website so people understand that you collect data, why you need it, and how you plan to use it. Transparency is key, so always direct people to this Policy before collecting their data. For instance, when someone creates an account on your website, ensure they read the Privacy Policy first.

#### Data Minimisation

Only collect the data you need for a specific purpose. For example, if you’re selling clothes online, you don’t need someone’s Social Security Number. If you use cookies to collect data like IP addresses, inform users before doing so. Always ask yourself if a piece of data is truly necessary. If not, don’t collect it.

#### Personal Data Recording

Recording personal data involves keeping any information that could identify a person. Examples include recording minutes from meetings with clients, keeping records of correspondence, or recording phone calls with customers. If you rely on consent to process data, you must prove that consent was given. This includes recording the data subject’s name or identifier, the date and time consent was given, what they consented to, and how they consented. Store all records securely, even if it’s just confirmation of consent.

#### Storing Personal Data

After collecting and recording personal data, you need to store it securely to meet GDPR’s confidentiality and security requirements. Examples of storing data include keeping customer emails, recording names and addresses on spreadsheets, or scanning invoices. While GDPR doesn’t specify exactly how to store data, Article 32 suggests using encryption or pseudonymisation. Encryption scrambles data so that it’s unreadable without a password, while pseudonymisation involves storing data in a way that individual pieces of information can’t identify anyone.

Include a brief clause about data storage in your Privacy Policy, highlighting that you use safeguards to protect personal data.

#### Organising Personal Data

As you collect more personal data, it becomes crucial to organise it properly. Organising or structuring personal data is considered a processing activity under GDPR, and you must do it correctly. This ensures you can quickly produce data if someone requests it, in line with the data portability principle, and it helps you avoid penalties during audits by Data Protection Authorities (DPA). Organising data might involve filing it away, creating customer records, or collating information on a spreadsheet or database. Regularly audit your procedures to know where information comes from, what categories of data you process, where you store it, and what data leaves your company. For larger companies or those handling sensitive data, it may be wise to seek help from a specialist IT provider.

#### Personal Data Disclosure

Disclosing personal data involves transmitting it within your organisation or to external parties. Internal transmission, like sharing customer details with another team member, requires you to protect the data from both external threats and unauthorised personnel. You can secure internal communications by encrypting data, using strong passwords, or segmenting a private network.

For external data sharing, such as disclosing data to marketing agencies, you need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). A DPA outlines the relationship between you (the data controller) and the third party (the data processor). The processor must follow GDPR guidelines, and you should only sign a DPA with a company that has adequate safeguards in place.

#### Amending Personal Data

Personal data must be accurate, which means individuals have the right to amend their information. You can also amend data if you spot an error, but you must keep a record of any changes to comply with recording duties. Always inform people of their right to amend data, as this is a central aspect of GDPR.

#### Personal Data Destruction or Erasure

Destroying or erasing data is considered a processing activity under GDPR. This may occur when someone withdraws consent, you no longer need the data, or to comply with the "right to be forgotten" as set out in Article 17. Although this right isn’t absolute, meaning you can retain data if required by law, you should regularly review the data you store and delete it when it’s no longer necessary. Article 5 mentions storage limitation, so scheduled data reviews are a simple way to comply with your GDPR obligations.

## French Laws and Regulations

### The Data Protection Act

The **Loi sur la Protection des données** (Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978) is France’s law governing the protection of personal data. It has been amended several times, notably to incorporate the provisions of the GDPR and the “Police-Justice” directive.

It include the protection of individuals’ rights, such as the right to access, rectify, and oppose the processing of their data. The law also regulates the legality of data processing activities and imposes obligations on data controllers and processors. Additionally, it outlines the role of the French Data Protection Authority, CNIL (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés), which oversees compliance and has the authority to impose sanctions for violations.

### Other Relevant National and International Regulations

Beyond the Data Protection Act, other national and international regulations are crucial for ensuring the protection of personal data. One example is the **“Police-Justice” directive**, which has been transposed into French law. This directive addresses data processing for purposes such as preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting criminal offences, or executing criminal penalties. It establishes rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities in the context of law enforcement, ensuring privacy rights are respected even in sensitive areas like criminal justice and public security.

Additionally, specific sectors, such as healthcare or telecommunications, may be subject to tailored data protection regulations that cater to the unique privacy challenges of their industries. These legal frameworks are designed to protect individuals' rights and hold organizations accountable for their handling of personal data.

In addition to these national frameworks, several key international regulations also play a significant role in the global data protection landscape. Here are some important examples:

- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Grants California residents rights over their personal data, including the right to know, delete, and opt-out of data sales.

- **Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD)**: Similar to the GDPR, it governs personal data processing in Brazil, providing rights to access, correct, and delete data.

- **Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Regulates how businesses handle personal information in Canada, balancing privacy with commercial needs.

- **APEC Privacy Framework**: Promotes data privacy standards for cross-border data transfers in the Asia-Pacific region.

- **Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)**: Governs personal data processing in Japan with requirements for transparency and consent.

- **South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**: One of the world’s strictest privacy laws, regulating data minimization, consent, and transparency in South Korea.

These regulations, like the GDPR, form a global framework aimed at protecting personal data while accommodating regional differences.
