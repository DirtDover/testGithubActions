# Rights of Data Subjects under the GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is designed to protect individuals' rights regarding their personal data, ensuring that they have greater control and transparency over how their data is collected, used, and processed. These rights are fundamental to the GDPR and apply to any organization handling personal data, ensuring that data subjects are informed, empowered, and protected.

## Individual Rights under the GDPR

It grants several rights to individuals concerning their personal data. These rights are intended to guarantee transparency, security, and control over personal data. Understanding these rights is crucial for both data subjects and organizations that handle personal data, as they form the foundation of data protection practices under the regulation.

### Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Data Portability

One of the cornerstones of the GDPR is the right of individuals to **access** their personal data. This right allows individuals to know if their data is being processed, and if so, to access that data along with certain supplementary information. For example, individuals can request access to their data such as account details, purchase history, or communication logs. This information can typically be accessed through user interfaces like online account dashboards or customer service portals that offer data access requests.

Similarly, the right to **rectification** is essential for maintaining the accuracy of personal data. If an individual’s data is incorrect or incomplete, they have the right to request that it be corrected. For instance, if a user’s address is outdated in a database, they can request an update through account settings on a website or via a support ticket submitted through an app or website interface. This ensures that decisions based on personal data are made on accurate and up-to-date information.

The right to **erasure**, often referred to as the "right to be forgotten," empowers individuals to request the deletion of their personal data under specific circumstances. This might include cases where the data is no longer necessary for the original purpose it was collected, or if the individual withdraws their consent. For example, users can request the deletion of their profiles or personal information via account settings, privacy request forms, or by contacting customer support. This right ensures that individuals can remove their data from systems where it is no longer needed, thereby protecting their privacy.

Data **portability** is another significant right, enabling individuals to receive the personal data they have provided to a data controller in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This could include data like contact information, transaction history, or user preferences. For example, users might be able to export their data from a service in formats like CSV or JSON through an export function in their account settings. This right also allows individuals to transfer their data to another controller without hindrance, facilitating greater control and flexibility over their personal data.

These rights are implemented through various interfaces and tools provided by organizations, such as online account management systems, data access request forms, and customer support channels, ensuring that individuals can exercise their data rights effectively.

### Erasure and Opposition

the possibility of being deleted, or "to be forgotten," is a powerful tool for individuals wishing to have their personal data removed from a controller’s system. This right applies in situations such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, when the individual withdraws consent, or when they object to the processing under certain conditions.

The right to object allows individuals to challenge the processing of their personal data on specific grounds. For example, if the processing is based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes, individuals can object to such processing. The data controller must then cease processing the data unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the individual, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

## Implementing Data Subject Rights

To effectively uphold the rights of data subjects, organizations must establish clear and efficient procedures. This involves ensuring that requests from individuals are handled promptly, accurately, and in compliance with the GDPR’s requirements. Implementing these procedures is not only a legal obligation but also a vital aspect of maintaining trust and transparency with data subjects.

### Procedures for Responding to Individual Requests

When a data subject exercises their rights, the data controller must acknowledge the request and respond within one month. In cases where the request is complex or involves a large volume of data, this period can be extended by up to two additional months. However, the data subject must be informed of any delay and the reasons for it.

Verifying the identity of the individual making the request is critical to prevent unauthorized access to personal data. This step ensures that the data controller does not inadvertently disclose personal information to the wrong person, which could lead to a breach of privacy.

While the GDPR generally requires that the exercise of rights be free of charge, there are exceptions. If a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive, the data controller may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. However, the burden of proving that a request is unfounded or excessive lies with the data controller.

### Practical Examples of Implementing Data Subject Rights

To assist in the implementation of data subject rights, organizations like the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) offer practical guidance. For instance, when collecting data through forms, organizations should provide clear and accessible information about the purpose of data collection and the rights of individuals.

In a workplace context, employees should be informed about the collection of data through access badges, geolocation of company vehicles, or the use of video surveillance. This transparency ensures that employees are aware of how their data is being used and their rights under the GDPR.

In commercial activities, such as marketing, organizations must inform customers and prospects about how their data will be used for commercial purposes. This includes clear communication about the data collection process and providing easy-to-understand options for opting out of data processing for marketing purposes.
