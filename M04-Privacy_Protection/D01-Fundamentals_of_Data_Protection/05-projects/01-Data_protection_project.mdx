# Privacy Diagnostic for IBC Bank’s HR Recruitment Process

## Context

You have been engaged to perform a **Privacy Diagnostic** specifically focused on IBC Bank’s **HR recruitment process**. This involves understanding how personal data from candidates and employees is handled during recruitment, where it’s stored, and how it aligns with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR.

The recruitment process involves multiple data sources—online application portals, external recruitment agencies, job fairs, and internal candidate files. Given the sensitivity of personal data (e.g., candidate resumes, background information, test results), IBC wants to ensure that their HR practices meet strict data protection standards.

Your mission this afternoon is to **map out the personal data used in the HR recruitment process**, identify applicable privacy requirements, and note initial potential compliance gaps. This foundational work will guide further analysis and targeted recommendations in subsequent sessions.

## Objectives

- **Data Landscape Mapping (HR Focus):**  
  Identify categories of candidate and employee data processed during recruitment (e.g., CVs, personal details, test results). Determine which systems store this data (recruitment portal, HR databases, manager’s local files) and who can access it.

- **Regulatory Context (GDPR and Others):**  
  Confirm which privacy laws apply (e.g., GDPR for EU operations). Consider if data is transferred outside the EU or if additional safeguards (such as SCCs) are needed. Note if other regulations (like CCPA for certain candidates) could be relevant.

- **Policy Review & Governance (HR-Specific):**  
  Examine IBC’s internal HR policies, any data retention guidelines for candidate files, and how consent and data subject rights are currently handled in the recruitment context.

- **Preliminary Risk Identification:**  
  Note areas where personal data may be over-collected, where consent mechanisms might be insufficient, or where vendor relationships (e.g., external test providers, recruitment agencies) lack GDPR-compliant contracts. Identify any use of sensitive data (religion, disability) without clear legal basis.

## Deliverables

- **Preliminary HR Data Inventory:**  
  A rough outline of what personal/candidate data the HR process collects, where it’s stored (portal, shared folders, managers’ local drives), and who can access it.

- **Regulatory Mapping for HR Data:**  
  Notes linking identified candidate and employee data to relevant GDPR principles (data minimization, transparency, etc.). Consider any non-EU data transfers and their compliance.

- **Initial Gaps & Observations:**  
  Highlight obvious compliance issues, such as unclear consent for certain data fields, no defined retention period for candidate files, or absence of formal processes for handling data subject requests in the recruitment setting.

**By the end of the afternoon,** you will have a clear initial understanding of the personal data ecosystem within IBC’s HR recruitment process. This baseline diagnostic will pave the way for more detailed analyses, DPIAs, and actionable remediation steps to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and best practices.
