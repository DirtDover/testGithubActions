# Learning Objectives

## What you will learn in this course üßêüßê

- Overview of the Cybersecurity Lead training

You're about to start this **Cybersecurity Lead training**, which aims to equip you with all the skills a cybersecurity consultant needs to succeed in this field.

This course is hands-on, allowing you to apply what you've learned through practical exercises and real-world scenarios.

Each day covers a different aspect of being a cybersecurity consultant, helping you understand the challenges and skills required for success in this field.

## Module 1: Method Review and Tool Setup

In this module, we take a breath before diving into the more technical modules.

We will review the methodologies and set up the tools you'll need to succeed in this bootcamp.

## Module 2: Risk Management and Penetration Testing (Purple Team)

In this module, we‚Äôll cover risk management and penetration testing, which are more organisational aspects of cybersecurity.

- **Information Security Governance and Audit Methodology**

How can a business structure itself to handle risks? You'll learn about security governance concepts and how to establish frameworks that ensure information security. We‚Äôll dive into standards and regulatory frameworks. Finally, you‚Äôll learn how to conduct a security audit effectively.

- **Cybersecurity Risk Management**

Another day in the world of standards, but this time focusing on risk management. How do you assess and prioritise risks? How do you implement a solid risk management policy?

- **Business Continuity Planning and Implementation**

How can you recover effectively after an incident? You‚Äôll learn how to set up a business continuity plan and align it with other relevant plans.

## Module 3: Security Assessment and Testing (Red Team)

In this module, we‚Äôll explore how to assess and test the security of a system. This is the most well-known aspect of cybersecurity and what people often imagine when they think about the field.

- **Static code analysis**

On the second day, you‚Äôll learn static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities in a client's source code.

- **Fuzzing**

Next, we‚Äôll dive into fuzzing, a security testing technique that sends random data to a program to uncover vulnerabilities. This is an essential tool for any cybersecurity consultant.

- **Advanced Web Pentesting Part 1 and 2**

We‚Äôll then spend two days on web pentesting, one of the most in-demand skills in cybersecurity. Knowing how to conduct these audits is crucial.

- **API Pentesting**

Next, we'll cover API pentesting, as APIs are increasingly used in modern applications. It's vital to know how to test and secure them.

- **CI/CD Pentesting**

Security in CI/CD pipelines is often overlooked by developers and businesses. We‚Äôll cover how to test and secure these tools.

- **Cloud Pentesting**

Most companies opt for cloud services instead of self-hosting. You‚Äôll learn how misconfigurations in the cloud can expose sensitive data (and more).

- **IAM Pentesting**

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial part of an organisation's security. We‚Äôll audit these systems to ensure they are robust.

- **Pentesting Activities Summary**

Finally, we‚Äôll wrap up this module with a day dedicated to writing security reports and communicating your findings to clients. This is a key part of being a successful cybersecurity consultant.

## Module 4: Privacy Protection

Privacy protection is a major concern in our society. We‚Äôll explore how to protect personal data and comply with regulations.

- **Data Protection Fundamentals**

Ever heard of GDPR? No? Well, by the end of this day, it will be crystal clear. We‚Äôll explore how to protect data while adhering to GDPR and other regulations.

- **Personal Data Management and Information Security**

Compliance, personal data management, and the role of the DPO are key topics we‚Äôll cover to understand why data protection is a critical issue for businesses.

- **Compliance Audits and Responding to Data Breaches**

How do you conduct a compliance audit for data protection? How should you react to a data breach? You‚Äôll learn how to handle these sensitive situations.

## Module 5: Incident Management

Attacks happen to everyone. It‚Äôs crucial to know how to respond to a security incident and protect yourself.

- **Organisation and Initial Response**

How should you respond to a security incident? You‚Äôll learn how to build an incident response organisation and react appropriately.

- **Incident Response and Forensics Parts 1 and 2**

Forensics is the art of tracking an attacker‚Äôs steps. You‚Äôll learn how to conduct a forensic investigation, pinpoint key moments in an attack, and draft an incident report.

- **Reverse Engineering**

Mastering reverse engineering means understanding how software (especially malware) works. It‚Äôs a valuable skill for understanding and defending against attacks.

## The End!

Congratulations! You've reached the end of this training. Over the weeks, you‚Äôve developed all the necessary skills, both hard and (most importantly) soft skills, to succeed in the world of cybersecurity.
