In this lecture, you'll learn about the various types of engagements you can undertake as an offensive cybersecurity consultant. We will also cover the steps involved in a typical engagement and the legal documents used to frame and guide these missions.

## Types of Engagements

As an offensive cybersecurity consultant, you can be involved in several types of engagements. Each type has its specific goals and methods.

**Penetration Testing** involves simulating cyber attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system, network, or application. The primary goals are to identify security weaknesses, test the effectiveness of security measures, and provide recommendations for improving security. This type of engagement helps organizations understand their security posture and prioritize improvements.

**Red Teaming** takes a more comprehensive approach than penetration testing. It simulates real-world attacks to test an organization's detection and response capabilities. This engagement evaluates security posture, tests incident response plans, and identifies gaps in detection and response mechanisms. It provides a realistic assessment of how well an organization can defend against advanced threats.

**Vulnerability Assessment** involves scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications without exploiting them. The goals are to identify potential security issues, prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, and provide a roadmap for remediation. This engagement helps organizations understand their exposure and focus on critical vulnerabilities.

**Social Engineering** engagements test the human element of security by attempting to deceive employees into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. The objectives are to assess the effectiveness of security awareness training, identify susceptibility to phishing and other social engineering attacks, and improve organizational policies and training. This type of engagement highlights the importance of human factors in security.

**Application Security Testing** focuses on identifying vulnerabilities within software applications through methods such as static and dynamic analysis, code review, and penetration testing. The goals are to ensure software security throughout the development lifecycle, identify and remediate security flaws in applications, and enhance secure coding practices. This engagement helps developers create more secure applications and reduce the risk of exploitation.

## Steps of an Engagement

Engagements typically follow a structured process to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness. Here are the 7 steps to properly conduct an audit in compliance with current legal regulations. You'll notice that steps 2 to 5 are typical of a standard hacking process. What makes it legal are steps 1, 6, and 7, which are therefore the most important in the consulting profession.

### 1. Scoping and Planning

This initial phase involves defining the scope of the engagement, understanding the client's requirements, and planning the activities to be performed. Key activities include defining objectives and goals, identifying the scope (targets, timelines, constraints), and developing a detailed plan of action. This phase sets the foundation for a successful engagement by aligning expectations and establishing clear guidelines.

### 2. Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance (or recon) involves gathering information about the target to plan the attack. This can be passive (e.g., public information) or active (e.g., network scanning). Key activities include collecting public information about the target, identifying potential entry points, and analyzing the gathered data for vulnerabilities. Effective reconnaissance provides valuable insights into the target's infrastructure and potential weaknesses.

### 3. Enumeration

Enumeration involves identifying and listing the target's active systems, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Key activities include scanning for open ports and services, enumerating users, groups, and shares, and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the discovered services. This phase provides a detailed understanding of the target's attack surface and helps prioritize subsequent actions.

### 4. Exploitation

In this phase, you attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system. Key activities include executing exploits to gain access, maintaining stealth and avoiding detection, and documenting the exploitation process and results. Successful exploitation demonstrates the potential impact of vulnerabilities and provides evidence for remediation efforts.

### 5. Post-Exploitation

Post-exploitation involves actions taken after gaining access, such as data extraction, privilege escalation, and pivoting to other systems. Key activities include extracting sensitive data, escalating privileges to gain higher access, and moving laterally within the network to other targets. This phase provides insights into the potential damage that could be caused by a successful attack and helps identify additional security gaps.

### 6. Reporting

Reporting is a critical phase where you document your findings, methodologies, and provide recommendations for remediation. Key activities include preparing a detailed report of findings, providing actionable recommendations, and conducting a debrief with the client to discuss the results. Clear and comprehensive reporting helps clients understand the risks and take appropriate actions to improve their security.

### 7. Remediation and Follow-Up

After reporting, you may assist the client in addressing the identified vulnerabilities and verifying the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. Key activities include supporting the client in fixing vulnerabilities, re-testing to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed, and providing ongoing support and advice. This phase ensures that the identified issues are resolved and helps maintain a strong security posture.

## Legal Documents

To ensure engagements are conducted legally and ethically, several legal documents are used.

**A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** ensures that any sensitive information shared during the engagement is kept confidential. Key elements include the definition of confidential information, obligations of both parties, and the duration of confidentiality. NDAs protect both the client and the consultant by preventing unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

**The Rules of Engagement (RoE)** outlines the scope, limitations, and rules for the engagement, ensuring both parties agree on what is allowed and what is not. Key elements include the scope of the engagement, allowed and prohibited activities, and timeframes and constraints. The RoE provides a clear framework for the engagement and helps avoid misunderstandings and legal issues.

**A Statement of Work (SoW)** provides a detailed description of the work to be performed, deliverables, and timelines. Key elements include a detailed description of tasks and objectives, deliverables and milestones, and timelines and deadlines. The SoW ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of the engagement's objectives and expectations.

**The Letter of Authorization (LoA)** is a formal document from the client authorizing the consultant to perform the engagement activities. Key elements include authorization to conduct specific activities, identification of targets, and duration of authorization. The LoA provides legal protection for the consultant by granting explicit permission to carry out the engagement.
