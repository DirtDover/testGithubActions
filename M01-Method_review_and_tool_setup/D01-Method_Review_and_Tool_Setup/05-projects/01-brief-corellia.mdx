# Welcome to Corellia - Cybersecurity Consulting

Welcome to **Corellia**, a leading consulting firm specializing in advanced cybersecurity solutions. As a consultant at Corellia, you are part of an elite team trusted by major organizations across the galaxy to protect their most sensitive data and systems.

## A New Challenge: Penetration Testing for IBC

We are excited to announce that Corellia has just secured a major contract with **IBC (InterGalactic Banking Clan)**, one of the largest financial institutions in the galaxy. IBC has entrusted Corellia with conducting a full-scale **penetration testing** (pentest) of their systems to identify vulnerabilities and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.

This is a critical project, as IBC handles billions of transactions daily and is a prime target for cybercriminals. Your role as consultants will be to assess their defenses and provide actionable insights to ensure they remain impenetrable to external and internal threats.

## Your Mission

Over the next several weeks, you will be assigned to various pentesting missions, each focusing on a different aspect of IBC's infrastructure. These missions will simulate real-world cyberattacks and aim to uncover weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.

You will be responsible for:

1. **Identifying vulnerabilities** in IBC's networks, applications, and systems.
2. **Conducting in-depth analyses** of potential security flaws.
3. **Recommending mitigations** to strengthen their security.
4. **Collaborating** with IBC's internal cybersecurity team to provide feedback.
5. **Delivering professional reports** for each mission, detailing your findings and suggestions.

These reports will be presented to IBC’s leadership team, so they must be clear, concise, and professional.

## What's Next

This contract with IBC represents a significant opportunity for Corellia, and your work will directly impact the success of our engagement with them. As a Corellia consultant, your expertise and diligence are crucial in delivering the high standards that our clients expect.

Prepare yourselves for an intense and rewarding experience as you dive deep into the systems of one of the galaxy’s most influential financial institutions.

May the force be with you.
