# Setup your environment

Every good pentester needs a well-configured workspace to be effective. In this exercise, you'll set up the tools you'll need for the coming days.

We assume you'll be working on a **Kali Linux** system, but most of the time you can adapt it to work on macOS or Windows.

<Note type="warning">

If you do not have enough disk space on your computer, you can install those tools only when needed. We recommend to set up your environment now to avoid any issues during the course.

We recommend having at least **100 GB of free disk space** to install all the tools.

</Note>

- Install your reporting tools like [Pwndoc](https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).
- A note-taking app is also handy. You can use [CherryTree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/) (open source), [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) (open source), [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) (open source), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (closed source), or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (closed source).
- We'll need [AFL++](https://aflplus.plus/building/).
- And [`fuff`](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
- Install [SonarScanner CLI](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner/).
- You'll also need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (recommended on Windows and Linux) or [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) (recommended on macOS).
- Download a Windows 10 VM ([direct download link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=2208844&clcid=0x40c)) or [Windows 11](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/).
- Download the [SIFT distribution](https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/) developed by SANS.
- Make sure you have a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).
- You'll also need [IDA Free](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/#download).

And, of course, don't forget your favourite pentesting tools!
