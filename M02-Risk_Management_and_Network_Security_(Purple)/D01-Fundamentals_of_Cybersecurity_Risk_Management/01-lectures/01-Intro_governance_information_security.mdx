## Governance Concepts

In this discussion, we'll explore the importance of governance and the various tools and frameworks that help manage information security and establish effective governance.

**What is governance?** It's the collection of policies, tools, and actions dedicated to protecting an organisation's digital resources.

Wondering why it's important?

We won't repeat the usual spiel about the central role of digital technology in today's economy and businesses. Attacks are increasing, and threats are growing. Compromising digital tools can lead to multiple, severe consequences for a company.

Historically, IT departments handled security governance. People viewed it as a technical issue relevant only to developers. That's no longer the case.

Company leaders now understand the importance of **implementing governance to manage security across the entire organisation**. Security governance is now considered at every level of the company and for all departments.

## Management and Operations

### Governance

Governance stands apart from management and operations. You can think of governance as the **top of the pyramid**, followed by management, and then operations. Everything flows from governance down to operations.

Governance operates at a **strategic level**, involving the organisation's leadership.

At its core, it involves setting the vision and overall information security goals. It's like plotting coordinates for a grand voyage, ensuring everyone knows the destination and the steps to get there.

Next comes **aligning security with business objectives**. Think of it as making sure the ship's course matches the company's major trade routes. Security shouldn't just be a lifebuoy; it needs to be part of the journey, reinforcing the organisation's goals.

**Allocating resources and budgets** might seem as exciting as sharing the ship's rations, but it's crucial. Proper funding and resource allocation ensure that security initiatives have the wind in their sails and aren't left adrift.

Defining security policies and the overall framework is like establishing the ship's code. Clear and comprehensive policies ensure everyone on board knows the rules and how to follow them, keeping everything shipshape.

Finally, **overall supervision and ultimate responsibility** lie with the leadership. They are the ship's captain, overseeing the entire voyage, ready to navigate through turbulent waters, solve problems, and adjust strategies as needed. Governance, in essence, is about steering the ship safely to its destination.

### Management

Management operates at the **tactical level**, bridging governance and operations.

It involves implementing the policies and strategies defined by governance. Think of it as translating the captain's grand vision into concrete actions on deck.

Next is **planning and coordinating security initiatives**. Imagine a conductor ensuring each instrument plays its part in harmony. Every initiative must be carefully planned and coordinated to ensure smooth execution.

**Risk management and compliance** form another crucial aspect. Picture a lookout watching for potential dangers and ensuring the ship complies with all regulations. This involves identifying risks, assessing them, and implementing measures to mitigate them.

**Reporting** to the leadership on the state of security is equally important. It's about keeping the captain informed of the situation on board. Regular reports enable the leadership to stay updated and make informed decisions.

Finally, **overseeing operational teams is essential**. It's like leading a crew of sailors, ensuring everyone knows their role and performs it effectively. Management involves monitoring performance, providing support, and ensuring everyone works together to achieve security goals.

### Operations

Operations focus on the **technical level and daily execution**.

They start with **implementing and maintaining technical security controls**. It's like installing sturdy locks on all the ship's doors and ensuring they always work perfectly.

Next is **managing security incidents**. Think of firefighters on board, ready to respond at the slightest hint of fire. Each incident must be handled quickly and effectively to minimise damage.

**Monitoring and threat detection** are equally essential. It's like having a lookout scanning the horizon for pirates. Teams must constantly monitor the environment to detect potential threats before they become problems.

**Administering security tools and systems** is another key task. It's akin to ensuring all the ship's equipment is in good working order. Each security tool and system must be properly configured, updated, and managed to ensure optimal protection.

Finally, **performing daily tasks** to ensure security is fundamental. Think of routine ship maintenance: cleaning the deck, checking the rigging, and ensuring everything is in order. Teams must carry out routine tasks to maintain a high level of security day after day.

## Key stakeholders

The main stakeholders in information security governance ensure robust and effective protection for the company. Let's take a closer look at who they are.

### The stakeholders

**Senior Management** plays a central role in defining strategic security objectives and actively engaging in the process. Their involvement at the highest level is crucial to set the tone and importance of security.

The **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** is responsible for implementing and managing the Information Security Management System (ISMS). This role requires deep technical expertise and a clear vision of security challenges.

The **IT Department** works closely with the CISO to integrate security measures into the IT infrastructure. This synergy ensures that security controls are not only in place but also aligned with the organisation's technological objectives.

The **Chief Risk Officer (CRO)** plays a crucial role in identifying and assessing information security risks. Their work prioritises actions and establishes effective mitigation strategies.

**Internal audits** form the third line of defence. These independent audits validate the processes and controls in place, providing an objective assessment of the effectiveness of security measures.

Most of the time, internal audits rely on external auditors from a recognised firm to ensure objectivity and thoroughness. This helps the management base its decisions on tangible, verifiable elements. **It‚Äôs a crucial tool for information security governance in France**.

The **Legal and Compliance Team** ensures that the organisation adheres to relevant laws and regulations. Their expertise is essential to avoid legal pitfalls and maintain the company's reputation.

Finally, **managers and employees** throughout the organisation play a role. Everyone must actively participate in implementing and adhering to security policies. Continuous awareness and training are essential to maintain high levels of vigilance and compliance.

Of course, these roles vary from one organisation to another. Some individuals may wear multiple hats, or others may fulfil the role of a key player without the official title. It's important to understand the distribution of roles to know how tasks are allocated later on.

### Collaboration

The various players in IT security governance work (theoritically üòâ) hand in hand to build a rock-solid defence against ever-evolving cyber threats.

Cybersecurity governance starts with the **involvement of top leaders**, like the executive committee (EXCO) and the board of directors. While the IT department is no longer the main player, i**t supports and educates the leadership team**.

**Communication and awareness** are also at the heart of this collaboration.

To achieve this, the CISO appoints a **champion** in each department who is responsible for spreading cyber governance, especially through managers. These champions act as information hubs and raise awareness among employees.

The players train and educate all employees about information security issues. They organise awareness campaigns, training sessions, and maintain regular communication about threats and best practices.

**Risk management is a collective effort**. Senior management, the risk officer, the CISO, and other stakeholders coordinate their efforts to identify, assess, and manage information security risks.

In short, this dynamic interaction between various players builds an IT security governance that's not only effective but also agile and responsive. A united team, ready to adapt to modern digital challenges, and most importantly, stay ahead of cyber threats.

## Strategic Alignment

### What is it?

**Strategic alignment is a crucial concept for any company** aiming to succeed in a competitive environment.

Cybersecurity is a support function. If it‚Äôs not aligned with the business, it won‚Äôt be effective. Governance ensures strategic alignment, which enables the information system to support the company's overall strategy.

Continuing with the ship metaphor: strategy is the map showing the destination, and strategic alignment is the mechanism ensuring that all crew members row in the same direction to reach that destination.

Why is it so important?

Firstly, a well-defined strategy allows the company to set **clear and ambitious goals**. However, without strategic alignment, these goals may remain mere intentions. Strategic alignment ensures that all company activities, **from daily operations to long-term projects**, align with the overall vision of the company.

Practically, this means that every department, service, and employee understands and contributes to achieving the strategic objectives.

For example, if a company decides to focus on innovation to stand out from the competition, all departments, including human resources, marketing, production, and IT, must work together to achieve this goal. HR can recruit innovative talent, marketing can promote new ideas, production can adapt its processes to incorporate innovations, and IT can develop technological tools to support these efforts.

Strategic alignment is especially important for information systems (IS). Nowadays, IS plays a crucial role in creating value for the company.

They no longer just produce reports or manage data; they have become drivers of innovation and differentiation. Therefore, it's essential that the IS strategy aligns perfectly with the company's overall strategy. This maximises the effectiveness of technological investments and ensures that information systems support the organisation's growth ambitions.

To achieve strategic alignment, several steps are necessary.

First, it's crucial to **start with the existing situation**, understanding the company's specifics, its organisation, and its internal and external environment.

Next, **identify the requirements** arising from the company's strategy and redefine the IS strategy accordingly. For example, if the leadership aims to develop an innovative product, the IT department must analyse the existing infrastructure and new technological possibilities to support this project.

**Planning and managing the strategy** are also essential. The IT department must prioritise projects that most effectively support strategic alignment and ensure perfect coordination with objectives throughout the project lifecycle. Communication and visibility are key elements of this approach. Good communication circulates information, facilitates idea sharing, and promotes team collaboration. Suitable tools, such as project portfolio management (PPM) software, can support this communication and facilitate operational management.

Finally, **strategic alignment is about transparency and cohesion**. All company members must be involved and informed about the strategic objectives. This requires effective change management, where decision-makers understand the constraints of IT services, and IT leaders are aware of business challenges.

In summary, strategic alignment is the guarantor of achieving the company's strategic objectives, ensuring that all activities align with the overall vision.

### How to Do It?

You're probably wondering, strategic alignment sounds great and definitely necessary... **But how?** We've touched on communication tools, but are there tools specifically designed for information security?

Well, the answer lies in standards (which we'll explore later). There are several, and **we'll focus on the tools provided by COBIT for strategic alignment**. Although it's not the only approach, it offers a solid understanding of the fields and actions needed for good strategic alignment.

Aligning security objectives with business strategies starts with **effective communication**. Security leaders and business executives must establish a continuous and constructive dialogue. This clarifies expectations and shows how security initiatives contribute to business goals. Regular communication turns security initiatives into essential components of the overall business strategy.

It's also crucial to **train and educate all employees** on the importance of information security. When employees understand how their roles impact overall security and business objectives, they become active participants in data protection efforts.

Using models and frameworks like the **Balanced Scorecard** and **COBIT's Goals Cascade** is also beneficial. The Balanced Scorecard helps align organisational activities with its strategic vision through financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth perspectives. COBIT's Goals Cascade, on the other hand, breaks down strategic objectives into more specific IT goals, ensuring alignment at all organisational levels.

Automating processes, such as **vulnerability assessments with SAST**, optimises efficiency and ensures that security measures meet business needs. This leads to better integration of security practices into daily business operations.

As mentioned earlier, **using collaborative tools** is essential as they ensure smooth communication and effective real-time information sharing. These tools help align teams towards common security goals.

The role of the **Business Information Security Officer (BISO)** can be valuable, even crucial. Acting as a bridge between security teams and other business units, the BISO ensures that security initiatives are integrated into the overall business strategy.

**Risk management** and **performance measurement** (in the form of KPIs) are critical components of the security strategy. Companies must actively identify, assess, and manage IT-related risks. Additionally, regular assessments to measure the effectiveness of security initiatives help maintain alignment with business goals and adjust strategies as needed.

Fortunately, the task of synchronising security objectives with business goals is greatly facilitated by recognised standards and frameworks such as ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST, or ITIL.

These frameworks provide proven structures and guiding principles that help organisations implement and manage their security strategies effectively. By offering the keys to success, these frameworks simplify the implementation of best practices in information security and ensure rigorous and consistent risk management aligned with the company's overall strategic objectives.

But that's another story!
