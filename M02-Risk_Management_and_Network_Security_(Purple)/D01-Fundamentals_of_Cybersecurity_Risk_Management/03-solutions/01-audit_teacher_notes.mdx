# TA Brief: ISO 27001 Security Audit for IBC

## Overview and Objectives

Module: 2 - Risk Management and Penetration Testing (Purple Team)

Focus: Conducting an ISO 27001 audit scenario through a role-play exercise, with short interview sessions.

### Exercise Format and Tools

Duration: 13:30 – 17:45
Methodology: ISO 27001 Audit
Tool: A shared Google Docs + CISO Assistant

### Learning Objectives

- ISO 27001 Audit Role Play:
  Students will still work in pairs, taking turns as auditor and client. This will encourage more direct and focused questioning.

- Meeting Reports:
  Students will produce a professional meeting report based on their interview.

- CISO assistant:
  Students will use CISO Assistant to record non-conformities and link them to ISO 27001 controls.

### ISO 27001 Sections to Consider

1. Review of information security policies and procedures:

   - Section 5.2 (Information Security Policy)
   - Section 8.1 (Operational Planning and Control)

2. Evaluation of risk management practices:

   - Section 6.1.2 (Information Security Risk Assessment)
   - Section 6.1.3 (Information Security Risk Treatment Options)

3. Verification of security incident management:

   - Section 16.1 (Information Security Incident Management)

4. Analysis of access control and user management processes:
   - Annex A – A.9 (Access Control)
   - A.9.2 (User Access Management)

## Daily Schedule

- 09:30 - 12:30: Teaching

- 12:30 - 13:30: Lunch Break

- 13:30 - 13:40: Brief: IBC ISO 27001 Audit Context

  - Introduce the scenario and ISO 27001 importance.
  - Emphasize the step-by-step process:
    1. Interview and take notes
    2. Meeting report drafting
    3. Recording findings in CISO Assistant

- 13:40 - 14:10: Exercise: ISO 27001 Audit (Round 1)

  - Student A = Auditor, Student B = Client.
  - 30 minutes: Auditor asks focused questions, Client responds.
  - Auditor takes detailed notes on paper or a note-taking tool (no direct entry into CISO Assistant yet).
  - Identify major non-conformities and relevant ISO controls.

- 14:10 - 14:40: Exercise: ISO 27001 Audit (Round 2)

  - Switch roles: Student B = Auditor, Student A = Client.
  - Another 30 minutes, same process.
  - More notes taken. No immediate CISO Assistant input.

- 14:40 - 15:00: Meeting Reports

  - Each student uses their notes to write a concise meeting report.
  - Reports must include:
    - Non-conformities found
    - ISO 27001 references
    - draft recommendations
  - Clarity and directness are key, given the time constraints.

- 15:00 - 15:10: Break

- 15:10 - 15:20: Q&A and Review

  - Address questions about mapping notes to ISO clauses or clarifying recommendations.
  - Briefly review selected reports for quality.

- 15:20 - 15:50: Reviewing Client Documents

  - Students simulate reviewing any additional documents or evidence provided by the client (as indicated by the TA).
  - Update notes or reports if necessary, still no data entry into CISO Assistant.

- 15:50 - 17:30: Recording in CISO Assistant

  - Students now take their final reports and notes to input findings into CISO Assistant.
  - Link each non-conformity to the correct ISO control.
  - Add action plans and finalize recommendations.
  - Generate compliance graphs and export results (e.g., PDF).
  - That's normal that we don't cover all the ISO 27001 clauses in this exercise. It's more about the process.

- 17:30 - 17:45: Presentation of the results

  - Each group will present the results of the audit.
  - Encourage students to review their notes and consider how time constraints affect auditing strategies.

- 17:45 - 18:00: Daily Recap and Closing
  - Summarize the day's activities.
  - Provide an overview of tomorrow's schedule and objectives.
  - Remind student to look at the next day's courses.

## Exercise Instructions

### Exercise: ISO 27001 Audit Role Play with Shorter Interviews

Objective:
Enable students to practice conducting an ISO 27001 audit under tighter time constraints, improving their ability to prioritize questions and findings.

#### Instructions:

1. Pair Formation:

   - Students form pairs and decide initial roles (auditor/client).

2. Short Interviews:

   - Each interview round is limited to 20-30 minutes.
   - Auditors must prioritize questions to quickly identify key non-conformities.

3. Linking to ISO Controls:

   - Encourage students to immediately link findings to specific ISO 27001 clauses (e.g., A.9.2 for user access issues).

4. Meeting Reports and Action Plans:

   - After interviews, each student writes their meeting report.
   - Reports must include non-conformities, their ISO references, and draft of recommendations.

5. Using CISO Assistant:

   - Students enter non-conformities into the tool.
   - CISO Assistant can be used to simulate document reviews, generate compliance graphs, and store interview notes.

6. Presentation of the results:
   - Each group will present what they found during the audit.
   - They will present the non-conformities, the recommendations, and the action plan.

#### TA Responsibilities:

- Monitor Progress:

  - Ensure students remain aware of the time limits.
  - Encourage them to focus on the most critical aspects of the audit.

- Provide Support:

  - Help students formulate targeted questions that yield useful insights quickly.
  - Suggest techniques for prioritizing non-conformities when time is limited.

- Encourage Collaboration:

  - Advise pairs to plan their questions before the interview starts to make the most of their 20 minutes.
  - If multiple pairs struggle, hold a brief group discussion on effective time management in auditing.

- Ensure Quality:
  - Spot-check meeting reports to ensure students are making concrete, actionable recommendations despite the shorter interview time.

## How to Help Students

1. Be Proactive:

   - Remind students of the time at the halfway point.
   - Suggest they skip less critical details to focus on major findings.

2. Encourage Questions:

   - Prompt students to ask you if they are unsure how to quickly identify relevant ISO 27001 controls.

3. Facilitate Peer Learning:

   - If one pair succeeds in extracting key information quickly, invite them to share their strategy with the group.

4. Provide Clear Explanations:

   - Offer quick examples of how to move from a vague answer to a concrete finding in minimal time.

5. Monitor Progress:

   - Keep track of pairs falling behind and suggest ways to speed up.

6. Focus on Daily Goals:
   - Emphasize that the exercise simulates real-world constraints where auditors often have limited time.
   - Encourage students to learn from the pressure and improve their efficiency.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Time Pressure:

  - Issue: Students may struggle to get detailed answers in 20 minutes.
  - Solution: Suggest that auditors ask more direct, closed-ended questions to quickly gauge compliance.

- Poor Note-Taking:

  - Issue: Students may record too little or too much detail.
  - Solution: Suggest focusing on critical incidents, clear non-conformities, and direct quotes.

- Prioritization:

  - Issue: Students may waste time on minor issues.
  - Solution: Remind them to focus on critical controls first, such as incident response or access management.

- Overly Generic Recommendations:

  - Issue: Students might still write broad recommendations.
  - Solution: Urge them to be specific, linking each finding to a particular control and suggesting a direct fix.

- Difficulty Linking Controls:

  - Issue: Students may not know which ISO clause applies.
  - Solution: Offer a quick reference cheat-sheet or point them to commonly cited clauses (A.9.2 for user access, for instance).

- Ineffective Time Management:

  - Issue: Students may not adapt their approach to the time constraints.
  - Solution: Encourage them to practice prioritizing questions and findings to maximize the limited time available.

- Superficial Analysis:

  - Issue: Students may skim over critical details due to time pressure.
  - Solution: Encourage them to focus on the most critical aspects of the audit and provide actionable recommendations.

- Shyness or Lack of Confidence:

  - Issue: Students may hesitate to ask direct questions or challenge the client.
  - Solution: Encourage them to be assertive and direct in their questioning to extract the necessary information efficiently.

- Tool Familiarity:
  - Demonstrate key features of CISO Assistant (uploading evidence, generating graphs) so students use it effectively.

## Additional Tips

- Prepare yourself by reviewing ISO 27001 clauses relevant to the scenario.
- Maintain strict time management: announce when time is half gone and when a few minutes remain.
- Be supportive and help students adapt to the time constraint.
- Maintain strict time management during the exercise.
- Collect feedback at the end to refine the time-constrained auditing approach for future sessions.
