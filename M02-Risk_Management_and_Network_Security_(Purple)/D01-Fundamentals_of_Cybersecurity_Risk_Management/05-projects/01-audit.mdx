# ISO 27001 Security Audit for IBC

## Context

As part of the ongoing efforts to enhance security, IBC has engaged your consulting firm to conduct a detailed ISO 27001 audit on its information security management system (ISMS). This audit is aimed at ensuring that the company's policies, procedures, and security controls are in compliance with the requirements of ISO 27001. The audit will help identify any gaps in the current system, assess the overall effectiveness of existing controls, and recommend necessary actions to address non-conformities.

IBC is a financial institution that processes sensitive customer data and transactions, making the security of their information systems critical for both regulatory compliance and business continuity.

## Consultant's Notes

- **Target**: Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- **Scope**:
  - **Review of information security policies and procedures**.
  - **Evaluation of risk management practices**.

  - **Analysis of access control and user management processes**.
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer and business data.
  - Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
  - Incident response and vulnerability management.
- **ISO 27001 Context**:
  - The audit will focus on the key controls specified by ISO 27001, particularly those related to risk management, access controls, and incident response.
  - The audit will include a Test of Design (TOD) to verify that policies and processes are in place and a Test of Effectiveness (TOE) to ensure that these controls are functioning as intended.

## Task

You are currently conducting an ISO 27001 audit and will focus on the following areas:

1. **Review of information security policies and procedures**: You will evaluate the existing security policies to determine if they are comprehensive, up-to-date, and in line with ISO 27001 requirements.

2. **Evaluation of risk management practices**: You will review the risk assessment processes to ensure that risks are properly identified, assessed, and managed, and that the appropriate mitigation strategies are in place.

3. **Verification of security incident management**: You will examine how security incidents are reported, managed, and resolved. This includes assessing the documentation of incidents and whether lessons learned are integrated into future security practices.

4. **Analysis of access control and user management processes**: You will verify the effectiveness of access controls, including how user privileges are assigned, managed, and revoked, as well as how access to sensitive systems and data is monitored.

You will need to prepare relevant and targeted questions for these interviews to gather insights on:

- The practical application of security controls in daily operations and project workflows.
- Existing challenges that prevent strict adherence to security measures or timely implementation of policies.
- The degree to which each role understands and executes their responsibilities for access control, vendor management, incident response procedures, vulnerability handling, data protection, and compliance fulfillment.

This comprehensive interview approach ensures a holistic view of IBC’s current security posture and compliance with ISO 27001 requirements.

### Deliverables

You will prepare a report that details:

- The non-conformities found in the specific areas mentioned above (Export it from CISO assistant).
- Actionable recommendations, including both immediate fixes and longer-term strategic changes to improve compliance and security effectiveness (CISO Assistant action plan).

This audit will help IBC strengthen its security posture and ensure that it meets the necessary standards for regulatory compliance.

## Helpers

You are going to use **CISO Assistant**, a tool that helps you to conduct security audits. It provides a structured approach to evaluate the security posture of an organization. You can access the tool [here](https://cisoassistant.com/).

## On-Demand Session Adaptations

**Context for On-Demand Sessions:**
For on-demand sessions, you will probably conduct the ISO 27001 audit independently rather than as part of a group. This format requires you to rely solely on provided documentation, interview briefs, and your own analysis to evaluate IBC’s ISMS.

**Key Adaptations:**

- **Simulated Interviews:**
Instead of live group interviews, you will receive interview briefs (ask it to your teacher assistant). Use these to identify non-conformities and link them to specific ISO 27001:2022 controls.

- **Individual Note-Taking and Reporting:**
You are responsible for independently capturing key findings, drafting your meeting report, and recording non-conformities in CISO Assistant. Ensure that every issue is mapped to its corresponding control.

- **Self-Managed Time Allocation:**
Without the structure of a group schedule, you will set your own pace to review documentation, perform your risk and control assessments, and complete your final audit report. Focus on critical areas such as policy review, risk management, incident handling, and access control.

- **Quantity of Analysis:**
I will do not need to provide a detailed analysis for each brief. Instead, focus on 2-4 of the one provided. This will allow you to provide a more in-depth analysis of the selected briefs.
