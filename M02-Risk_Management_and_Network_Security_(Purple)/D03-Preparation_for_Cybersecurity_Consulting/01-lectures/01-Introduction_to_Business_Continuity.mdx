## Concepts

**Business continuity** is crucial for any company that wants to survive and thrive despite major incidents. It involves planning ways to keep operating, even at a reduced capacity, when disruptions or incidents occur.

One key aspect of business continuity is **information security**. During a crisis, it's vital that company data remains protected and accessible. This includes measures to **prevent data loss**, unauthorized access, and service interruptions.

But why is this so important for businesses?

Firstly, it helps **preserve essential activities**. A **Business Continuity Plan** (BCP) acts like a roadmap, guiding a company to keep operating during a crisis, whether it's a natural disaster, cyberattack, IT failure, or other major incident.

Secondly, there's the **financial aspect**. Business interruptions can lead to massive financial losses. A BCP helps minimize these losses by enabling a quick recovery and avoiding prolonged downtimes.

Another key benefit is **protecting the company's reputation**. Effectively managing crises boosts reputation with customers, partners, and investors.

For some businesses, especially in the banking sector, business continuity is even a **regulatory requirement**.

**Risk management** and **resilience** are also fundamental aspects. A BCP identifies and manages potential risks before they occur. It includes preventive measures and crisis management procedures that strengthen the company's resilience to unexpected events.

For all these reasons, organizations implement a BCP, but that's not all, as we will see in the rest of this course.

## Terminology and Plans

There are many possible plans that help a company get back on its feet quickly. Let's briefly look at these before exploring them in more detail later.

Here's a comparative table of different business continuity and crisis management plans:

| Plan                              | Main Objective                                             | Scope                              | Key Elements                                                              | Activation Time         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Business Continuity Plan (BCP)    | Ensure continuity of critical business functions           | Entire organisation                | Risk analysis, continuity strategies, emergency procedures                | Immediate to short term |
| IT Continuity Plan (ITCP)         | Maintain essential IT systems and services                 | IT infrastructure and services     | Data backup, redundant systems, failover procedures                       | Immediate to short term |
| Operations Continuity Plan (OCP)  | Maintain essential operations                              | Specific operational processes     | Identify critical operations, necessary resources, alternative procedures | Short to medium term    |
| Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)      | Restore normal activities after an interruption            | Entire organisation                | Activity prioritisation, recovery steps, necessary resources              | Medium to long term     |
| IT Disaster Recovery Plan (ITDRP) | Restore IT systems after a major failure                   | IT systems and data                | Recovery sites, restoration procedures, regular testing                   | Short to medium term    |
| Crisis Communication Plan (CCP)   | Manage internal and external communication during a crisis | Communication and public relations | Designated spokespersons, key messages, communication channels            | Immediate               |

It's important to note that these plans are often interconnected and complementary within a broader risk management and business continuity strategy.

The **Business Continuity Plan** (BCP) (**Plan de Continuit√© d'Activit√©** (PCA) in french) is the most comprehensive and often includes the other plans. It aims to ensure the company's survival during a major crisis by covering all aspects of the organisation.

The **IT Continuity Plan** (ITCP) (**Plan de Continuit√© Informatique** (PCI) in french) and the **IT Disaster Recovery Plan** (ITDRP) (**Plan de Secours Informatique** (PSI) in french) focus specifically on information systems, which are essential in most modern companies.

The **Operations Continuity Plan** (OCP) (**Plan de Continuit√© des Op√©rations** (PCO) in french) focuses on maintaining critical operational processes, while the **Disaster Recovery Plan** (DRP) (**Plan de Reprise d'Activit√©** (PRA) in french) concentrates on fully restoring activities after an interruption.

Finally, the **Crisis Communication Plan** (CCP) (**Plan de Communication de Crise** (PCM) in french) is crucial for managing the company's image and maintaining stakeholder confidence during and after a crisis.

Through these different plans, a company can anticipate and respond to major incidents that, despite our best efforts, tend to happen when least expected.
