## Implementing the Plans

Implementing a plan like the BCP (and others) can seem daunting. Here are some tips to help you succeed!

It all starts with a **specification document**, which is sent to each critical resource manager. This document details what components need to be available, timelines, legal aspects, and so on. The managers then return their implementation details, such as timelines and financial requirements.

Next, business and process managers need to roll up their sleeves. They must integrate the actions, tools, and procedures of the plan **into their daily processes**.

This includes **creating documentation** for each procedure, from triggering conditions to required resources and expected outcomes. They also need to **prepare quick-reference guides** to know what to do in the first hour of a crisis, like a survival guide for the first 60 minutes of a zombie apocalypse.

Plan procedures are formalised simply and specifically for each role. Think of clear "action" sheets and "quick-reference" guides for each job.

To ensure the plan's implementation, you need the right resources. This includes specific provisions for human resources (like an on-call system), infrastructure (preparing fallback sites), and information systems (reviewing architecture, data backup procedures).

It‚Äôs also crucial to have specialised communication means in case public systems fail. These tools must be familiar and regularly used to avoid surprises. Finally, you need measures for economic security, sensitive data recovery, and partner failures.

There you go, you‚Äôre ready to implement a plan like the BCP! Easy, right?

## Simulation Exercises and Continuity Tests

As we discussed earlier, it's essential to test the plans through exercises and simulations.

There are different types of exercises.

**Tabletop exercises** allow you to discuss actions to take in a theoretical crisis scenario, identifying gaps without heavily mobilising resources. **Simulated exercises**, on the other hand, involve practical scenarios where procedures are activated as if a real crisis is happening, testing the organisation's ability to react in a coordinated manner. Finally, **technical tests** check the resilience of technological systems, like data backups and emergency communication systems.

For example, a tabletop exercise can verify the alert procedure, while a simulated exercise can test the coordination of various stakeholders during a major incident.

Planning the exercises requires meticulous attention. It's essential to **set clear objectives** for each exercise, such as testing response speed or team coordination.

The scenarios used must be **realistic** and based on the organisation‚Äôs specific risks. **All levels of the organisation must participate** in the exercises, from executives to employees, ensuring everyone understands their role and responsibilities during a crisis.

During the exercises, **document all steps**, decisions made, and actions taken.

After the exercise, a post-exercise analysis, or **Lessons Learned** (RETEX), is necessary to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Business Continuity Plan (BCP). The lessons learned should be used to update and improve the BCP.

The frequency of exercises is also crucial. **Regular exercises**, at least once a year, maintain a high level of preparedness. Additionally, extra exercises can be organised in response to significant changes in the organisation or the external environment.

## Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

Maintaining and continuously improving a plan is like tending a garden: you can't just plant the seeds and wait for everything to grow on its own. You need to water, prune, and sometimes weed to keep everything in top shape.

First, understand that the plan should be a **living document**, not a dusty binder forgotten on a shelf.

Regular checks are essential for each plan. This includes periodic reviews, maintenance of backup systems, failover tests, and both simulated and real training exercises. Keeping the plan up-to-date, measuring its maturity, revising procedures and systems, and using lessons learned (RETEX) are also crucial.

For plan documentation, a document management tool is recommended to manage and maintain all necessary documents. It's also wise to store a paper or digital copy of the documentation at an offsite location, in a secure and accessible place according to the scenarios considered.

Exercises play a key role in validating the plan's effectiveness. Each exercise should be designed to verify specific aspects, such as the alert procedure, crisis management team's functioning, or technical failover procedures.

Testing the plan's critical elements at least once a year is advisable, along with regularly checking the backup recovery procedure to ensure its effectiveness and performance.

Regular document reviews and meetings with those responsible for the plan's implementation are essential. This ensures that the resources, procedures, and organisations in the plan meet the objectives on paper and can be implemented within the planned timeframe. It's also crucial to ensure that the plans, documents, directives, and instructions are well-known and easily accessible under all circumstances.

Finally, verify the training, knowledge, competence, and understanding of each person's role defined in the BCP. This can be done through periodic internal audits, regular performance checks, compliance evaluations with standards (such as ISO 22301), and self-assessment questionnaires.

Comparisons with other organisations (benchmarking), regular testing of technical systems, and systematic feedback after each significant event are also valuable tools.
