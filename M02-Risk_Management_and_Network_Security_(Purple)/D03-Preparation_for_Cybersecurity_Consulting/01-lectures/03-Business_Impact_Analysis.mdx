## Definition

**Business Impact Analysis** (BIA) is an essential process for any company looking to prepare for unexpected interruptions. Unlike Risk Assessment (RA), which focuses on identifying potential hazards and how to prevent them, BIA assumes these interruptions will occur.

BIA identifies the critical processes of one business, the ones without which one operations can't function. It then evaluates the potential consequences of their interruption, whether it's financial loss, customer dissatisfaction, or decreased productivity. In other words, BIA asks: "If this disaster happens, what will the impact be and how can we respond effectively?"

While RA focuses on preventing incidents by assessing the likelihood and impact of risks, **BIA focuses on managing the consequences once the incident has occurred**.

It's like having a detailed Plan B for every possible disaster scenario to minimise damage and resume operations as quickly as possible.

**In short, RA helps you avoid problems, while BIA prepares you to handle them.**

## Identifying Critical Processes and Evaluating Interdependencies

Identifying critical processes and evaluating interdependencies help ensure **business continuity**.

When a company faces an interruption, some processes may be more impacted than others, and it's the cybersecurity consultant's job to pinpoint which processes are crucial to its proper functioning.

We start by using techniques like **process mapping**, a visual method that traces the flow of steps and activities within a business. This approach helps us understand the links between different processes and identify those that are truly critical. It also makes it easier to see key decision points and interdependencies between processes.

Next, we often **hold interviews with department heads**. These discussions are valuable as they help us understand how each process works on a daily basis and how they are connected.

It's not uncommon for a single manager to be involved in several processes, highlighting the importance of selecting the right contacts for each area.

We also use **standardised questionnaires** to gather information from a broad range of employees. These tools give us an overall view of the processes and their interdependencies.

Another effective method is **analysing historical data from past incidents**. By looking at what happened during previous disruptions, we can identify which processes were most affected and gain a better understanding of their significance.

**Evaluating interdependencies is a crucial step**. A process that appears non-critical at first glance can create a domino effect on other activities if it fails. If one falls, the others might follow.

The financial and operational impact of an interruption also helps highlight critical processes.

For example, in a company like M√©diam√©trie, managing audience measurement devices may seem secondary at first, but a prolonged delay in renewing these devices could become problematic within just a few weeks.

By combining all these techniques ‚Äì mapping, interviews, questionnaires, and data analysis ‚Äì we can accurately and thoroughly identify a company‚Äôs critical processes and ensure its business continuity, even in the face of major disruptions.

## Techniques for Assessing Potential Impacts

A simple technique for assessing the potential impact of a process is to **directly ask the people involved**.

For example, if the process for delivering new equipment gets interrupted, when would it start to be a problem? You might ask: "If the delivery doesn‚Äôt happen in a week, is that an issue?" If the answer is no, keep going: "What about two weeks? Three weeks? A month?"

The goal is to **find the threshold where the process becomes critical for the business**. It‚Äôs about understanding not just when the disruption becomes a problem, but why. This helps highlight dependencies between different processes.

By repeating this approach with several stakeholders, a **natural map of interdependencies begins to form**. It shows how processes are connected and when an interruption in one could impact others.

This assessment method makes it easier to prioritise processes based on their criticality and to anticipate risks to business continuity more effectively.
