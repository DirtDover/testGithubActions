# TA Brief: BIA Exercise for Alderaan Digital Banking (ADB)

Today, the students will conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) role-play exercise with detailed interviews of ADB’s critical process owners. They will fill out a Google Sheet template to capture their findings. The goal is to help students understand how BIA supports continuity planning, risk prioritization, and resource allocation.

## Overview and Objectives

**Focus:** Conducting a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** role-play exercise with detailed interviews of ADB’s critical process owners.

**Objective:**  
Guide students through a structured BIA exercise, where they collect data on business processes, RTO/RPO requirements, financial/regulatory impacts, and dependency mappings. They will fill out a **Google Sheet** template to capture their findings. The goal is to help students understand how BIA supports continuity planning, risk prioritization, and resource allocation.

**Format:**
- Students act as consultants from **Corellia**, assigned to **Alderaan Digital Banking (ADB)** by IBC.
- Each pair or small group conducts or role-plays interviews with designated roles.
- They record BIA data in a multi-sheet Google Sheet:
    - General information
    - Business Processes
    - Process RTO
    - IT Applications
    - Financials
    - Regulatory-Legal
    - Brand
    - Operational
    - Customer Satisfaction
    - Dependencies
    - Peak Periods
    - Overall BIA Score

## Daily Schedule

1. **13:30 – 13:45: BIA Brief Context and Role Assignments**
    - Present the ADB scenario: a fully online neobank under IBC.
    - Explain that as **Corellia** consultants, students must interview ADB’s process owners (or role-play them) to fill out each BIA sheet accurately.

2. **13:45 – 14:00: Tools and Template Review**
    - Introduce the multi-sheet Google Sheet template.
    - Highlight each tab (General information, Business Processes, etc.) and what data belongs in each.

3. **14:00 – 15:00: Round 1 Interviews**
    - Pairs or small groups meet with (or role-play) assigned stakeholders from ADB.
    - Gather initial data for each critical process (financial impact, RTO, dependencies).
    - Encourage detailed note-taking to ensure no field is left incomplete.

4. **15:00 – 15:15: Break**

5. **15:15 – 16:00: Round 2 Interviews / Further Data Gathering**
    - Continue or switch roles to gather more processes or refine incomplete sections.
    - Students can cross-check conflicting statements or incomplete entries in the BIA template.

6. **16:00 – 16:45: Data Consolidation and Sheet Completion**
    - Students refine each sheet (IT Applications, Financials, etc.).
    - Ensure each process has consistent RTO, RPO, financial losses, brand impact, and dependencies.

7. **16:45 – 17:30: Group Discussion / BIA Finalization**
    - TA checks for thoroughness in data entries.
    - Students finalize overall BIA scores, summarizing the top processes with highest impacts.
    - If time allows, short presentations or Q&A on key discoveries about ADB’s vulnerabilities.

8. **17:30 – 17:45: Debrief and Closing**
    - Summarize the day’s activities.
    - Provide an outline of the next steps (risk treatment, PCA & PRA, continuity planning).
   - Remind students to review course materials and prepare for the next session.

## Exercise Instructions

### Interview Protocol

1. **Scoping:**
    - Students must confirm each process’s name, purpose, and ownership.
    - Clarify if it is revenue generating, regulatory critical, or an internal service.

2. **Data Gathering:**
    - RTO/RPO: Elicit rationale behind each timeframe.
    - Financials: Seek approximate annual revenue, daily transaction volume, or penalty amounts.
    - Regulatory-Legal: Note any laws or compliance frameworks adding urgency to the process.
    - Brand and Operational: Check if disruptions severely damage reputation or hamper daily tasks.
    - Customer Satisfaction: Confirm the level of user frustration, potential churn.
    - Dependencies: List internal departments or external vendors crucial for the process.
    - Peak Periods: Indicate monthly or seasonal surges.

3. **Sheet-by-Sheet Completion:**
    - Students fill relevant details in each tab, ensuring consistency across all fields.

4. **Multi-Process Integration:**
    - Encourage cross-referencing if two processes rely on the same application or share the same vendor.
    - Identify any single point of failure that appears in multiple sheets.

## TA Responsibilities

1. **Monitor Progress:**
    - Circulate among groups to ensure all Google Sheet sections are covered.
    - Prompt students if they appear stuck on certain data points or misunderstand a tab’s purpose.

2. **Provide Support:**
    - Offer clarifications on how to record RTO vs. RPO.
    - Guide students in capturing intangible brand damage or compliance consequences.

3. **Encourage Active Questioning:**
    - Remind students to ask stakeholders (role-play or real) direct questions about monetary figures, downtime tolerance, or possible SLA violations.

4. **Ensure Completeness:**
    - Spot-check random Google Sheets for missing fields.
    - Challenge students who have incomplete dependencies or vague financial entries to refine them.

5. **Maintain Pacing:**
    - Announce time left in each interview session.
    - If students are behind, suggest moving to critical fields first (financial, regulatory, RTO).

## How to Help Students

1. **Be Proactive:**
    - Listen for confusion about specific fields like “peak periods” or brand damage. Provide factual clarifications without adding your own commentary.

2. **Validate Data:**
    - Encourage them to cross-verify if IT Applications and Dependencies match across different processes.

3. **Foster Collaboration:**
    - Suggest that if one pair found an interesting approach to capturing RTO logic, they share that technique with others.

4. **Time-Boxing Interviews:**
    - Students often get stuck in minor details. Remind them to note highlights and move on to next sections.

5. **Check for Overall Consistency:**
    - Where multiple processes use the same critical application, confirm the RTO for that application is the same in each Google Sheet record.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Overly Generic Impact Statements:**
    - Prompt them to specify an actual figure or timeframe when possible (e.g., “30% revenue drop in a week” or “2 million credits in penalties”).

- **Missing Dependencies:**
    - If a student claims a process has no dependencies, question whether a department, vendor, or application is truly absent from it.

- **Vague RTO or RPO:**
    - Remind them to provide reasoned justifications, not just random hours or days.

- **Unbalanced Work:**
    - Some pairs might overshadow others. Intervene if needed to ensure even engagement.

- **Lack of Confidence:**
    - Encourage direct, structured questioning. Provide a quick reference to typical BIA questions.
