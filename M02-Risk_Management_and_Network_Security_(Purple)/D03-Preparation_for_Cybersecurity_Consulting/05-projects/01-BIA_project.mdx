# BIA Exercise: Alderaan Digital Banking (ADB)

## Context

You are part of **Corellia**, a specialized cybersecurity consulting firm hired by the **InterGalactic Banking Clan (IBC)** to conduct a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** for **Alderaan Digital Banking (ADB)**, a fully online neobank subsidiary of IBC. Your consulting manager at Corellia has tasked you with this assignment, but you will also play the role of **ADB’s own employees** or process owners. By switching between **“consultant”** and **“employee”** perspectives (role-play), you will gather the necessary impact data to fill a comprehensive BIA template, ensuring that all critical operational nuances are captured from both an external audit standpoint and an internal business viewpoint.

## Objective

Complete a **BIA Template** (provided as a Google Sheet) for each critical process within ADB. The template has multiple sheets to capture the details required for a robust BIA:

1. **General Information**
2. **Business Processes**
3. **Process RTO**
4. **IT Applications**
5. **Financials**
6. **Regulatory-Legal**
7. **Brand**
8. **Operational**
9. **Customer Satisfaction**
10. **Dependencies**
11. **Peak Periods**
12. **Overall BIA Score**

Your goal is to accurately fill these sheets by **interviewing** or **role-playing** with respective ADB managers and owners of key processes. The final product will guide IBC leadership in prioritizing continuity plans, budgeting for risk mitigation, and understanding the immediate repercussions of potential disruptions.

## Roles

You will adopt **two different roles** at various stages of the exercise:

1. **Corellia Consultant:**
    - As a consultant, you approach interviews with structured questions, capture impact metrics, and focus on gathering enough detail to fill each sheet in the BIA.
    - Maintain a professional, methodical stance, as if reporting to your manager and ultimately to IBC’s management.

2. **ADB Employee (Process Owner):**
    - At times, you will portray the internal manager or staff member who deeply understands a specific business process.
    - Answer questions from the consultant perspective, providing RTO requirements, dependencies, financial impacts, and so forth.

By switching between these two viewpoints, you will simulate real interview interactions, clarifying potential misunderstandings or incomplete data, resulting in a more authentic BIA outcome.

## Methodology Overview

1. **Identify Processes and Owners**
    - List out ADB’s core and supporting business processes.
    - Assign each participant or group to both “own” a process (as an ADB employee) and “audit” another process (as a Corellia consultant).

2. **Collect Data According to Template Sheets**
    - **General Information**: Process name, short description, business objective, and classification (revenue generating, internal ops, or regulatory).
    - **Business Processes**: Workflow, critical steps, and performance metrics.
    - **Process RTO**: Maximum allowable downtime before severe impact.
    - **IT Applications**: Applications, databases, or SaaS services used by the process, along with RTO/RPO specifics.
    - **Financials**: Estimate daily or monthly revenue impacted by outages, potential fines, intangible brand consequences.
    - **Regulatory-Legal**: Identify relevant compliance standards and possible official criticisms or penalties.
    - **Brand**: Assess how brand reputation might suffer if the process is down or compromised.
    - **Operational**: Check complexities in skills, manual tasks, or availability of backups and subject matter experts.
    - **Customer Satisfaction**: Determine how quickly customers might become frustrated or switch to competitors.
    - **Dependencies**: Pinpoint internal or external units that feed or rely on this process.
    - **Peak Periods**: Identify timeframes with higher transaction volumes or sensitivity.
    - **Overall BIA Score**: Summarize each factor into an impact rating or priority ranking.

3. **Analyze Findings**
    - Compile data from multiple processes to see interdependencies, single points of failure, or areas where downtime might cause widespread damage.
    - Compare processes with particularly short RTO requirements or major financial exposures.

4. **Present Results (as needed)**
    - Produce a final BIA spreadsheet or set of documents capturing the essential details for each process.
    - If your manager requests it, highlight a top priority list of critical processes with highest financial or regulatory risk.

## Exercise Flow

1. **Corellia Consultant Round:**
    - Act as a cybersecurity consultant from Corellia, approaching one or more “ADB employees” to gather data.
    - Use a direct, methodical interview style to fill the respective BIA sheets.

2. **ADB Employee Round:**
    - Switch roles to portray the staff or department leader for a designated business process.
    - Provide honest, contextual answers about daily operations, financial stakes, dependencies, and known vulnerabilities or constraints.

3. **BIA Template Completion:**
    - Record the findings in each Google Sheet tab.
    - Ensure consistency across all fields (e.g., the same RTO for the same application).

4. **Final Review:**
    - Cross-check for missing or contradictory data.
    - Summarize findings into a cohesive BIA outcome that can stand on its own for IBC’s leadership.

## Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive [Multi-Sheet BIA Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14cv1XLjuB7IymCOMj2VZShix5c_iwVB1/copy):**
    - Each sheet (General Information, Business Processes, etc.) fully populated.
    - Detailed rationale for RTO, references to relevant regulations, quantification of financial risks.

2. **Optional Summary or Ranking:**
    - (If requested) A short explanation of the highest-impact processes, their time sensitivities, and costliest downtime scenarios.

<Note type="tip">

The sheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14cv1XLjuB7IymCOMj2VZShix5c_iwVB1/copy) or in the "Resources" section.

</Note>

## Constraints

- **Realistic Interview Exchange:**  
  Students should be precise but also acknowledge that real-life data can have uncertainties. Document major assumptions.
- **No Added Recommendations in the BIA:**  
  Keep the output strictly about impact data, not about how ADB or Corellia should fix problems.
- **Professional Tone, Substantive Detail:**  
  Your manager will expect a formal, thorough account. Avoid personal comments or tangential narratives.

## Conclusion

By merging **Corellia’s** professional interview framework with **ADB**’s internal knowledge, you will compile a credible **Business Impact Analysis** capturing the critical attributes of each business process. Your final product helps IBC and Alderaan Digital Banking strategize continuity plans, resource allocations, and risk mitigation efforts—reflecting the high standards of your cybersecurity consulting expertise.

May the Force guide both your consultant and employee perspectives to yield comprehensive, accurate BIA data.
