# EBIOS RM: online banking application

## Context

As part of the ongoing efforts to enhance security, IBC has engaged your consulting firm to conduct a risk analysis. The focus of this analysis will be the **online banking application**, which is used by customers to manage their accounts, perform financial transactions, and access sensitive information.

The goal of this exercise is to identify the key risks associated with the application and propose appropriate risk management strategies.

## Methodology

You will use the **EBIOS Risk Manager** methodology, as outlined in the official guide from ANSSI ([Guide link](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/la-methode-ebios-risk-manager-le-guide)). The analysis will be structured in several steps and workshops.

## Objectives

- Apply the **EBIOS RM** methodology to a simulated risk analysis.
- Identify and assess major risks related to the online banking application.
- Propose appropriate risk management strategies.
- Develop a risk treatment plan.

## Scope

The scope of the analysis is limited to the **online banking application**. This application handles sensitive operations, such as:

- Customer account creation and management.
- Viewing account balances and transaction histories.
- Transferring funds between accounts.
- Managing personal information (e.g., password changes, contact details).

Focus on the following areas:

1. **Technical vulnerabilities**: security weaknesses related to the technologies used (e.g., APIs, databases).
2. **Human threats**: potential cyberattacks, fraud, human errors.
3. **Third-party risks**: service providers and partners with access to the systems.

## Exercise Structure

The exercise is divided into **5 workshops**, following the **EBIOS RM** methodology. Each workshop represents a phase of the risk analysis and will be carried out in teams.

### 1. **Workshop 1 – Scoping and Security Foundations**

- **Objective**: Define the scope of the analysis and identify key security challenges for the application.
- **Task**: List the main security challenges and the security requirements.

### 2. **Workshop 2 – Risk Sources**

- **Objective**: Identify the sources of risk (e.g., malicious actors, human error, vulnerabilities).
- **Task**: Classify risks based on their likelihood and impact.

### 3. **Workshop 3 – Strategic Scenarios**

- **Objective**: Establish strategic risk scenarios based on identified vulnerabilities.
- **Task**: Develop scenarios representing critical risks to the company.

### 4. **Workshop 4 – Operational Scenarios**

- **Objective**: Analyze operational risks for each strategic scenario.
- **Task**: Evaluate the impact on the bank's operations if these scenarios occur.

### 5. **Workshop 5 – Risk Treatment**

- **Objective**: Propose strategies to mitigate the identified risks.
- **Task**: Develop risk treatment plans (e.g., acceptance, mitigation, transfer, rejection).

## Deliverables

At the end of the exercise, each team must present:

1. A **risk analysis report** summarizing the results from the 5 workshops.
2. A **risk treatment proposal** with recommendations to improve the security of the application.

This risk analysis will help IBC understand the threats to its online banking application and implement effective risk management strategies.
