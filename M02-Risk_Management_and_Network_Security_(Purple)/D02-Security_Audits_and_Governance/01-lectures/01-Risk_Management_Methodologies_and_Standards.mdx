## Definitions

Let's take a moment to define a few terms before diving into the main topic.

**Risk**, according to ISO 27005 (and ISO 27001), is the uncertainty that can affect an organisation's security objectives. It combines the likelihood of an undesirable event and its potential impact on sensitive information. Essentially, it's about measuring and managing what could go wrong with your data.

An **asset** is any valuable information resource for an organisation. This includes data, applications, information systems, networks, and even physical equipment.

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, network, or process that can be exploited by a threat to harm information security. This could be a software bug, inadequate security procedures, or insufficient staff training.

A **threat** is a potential event or situation that can exploit a vulnerability to compromise information security. Threats can be **intentional**, like a hacker attack, or **accidental**, like a power outage. They can originate from **inside** or **outside** the organisation.

**Impact** represents the potential consequences if a threat successfully exploits a vulnerability. This can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, operational disruption, or a leak of confidential data.

A **standard**, such as ISO 27005, sets out general requirements and guidelines that organisations should follow to ensure their information security. It defines principles and performance criteria. The standard isn't legally binding. It simply sets high benchmarks that allow companies to demonstrate they follow best practices.

On the other hand, a **method**, like EBIOS RM, is a structured and detailed approach to implementing these standards. It provides specific steps and tools to identify, assess, and manage risks, making it easier to apply the standards practically.

## Introduction to Standards and Methods

Once again, the world of standards and methods offers us promises of adventure, encounters, and an exciting life. Let's dive into ISO 27005 and several methods that align with it. Pack only what you need; the journey will be long and full of challenges, but we'll reach the end!

### The Standard: ISO 27005

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/ISO-27005.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

ISO 27005 is an international standard that provides **guidelines for managing information security risks**.

This standard is part of the larger family of ISO/IEC 27000 standards, all dedicated to information security. The main goal of ISO 27005 is to help you establish a process to manage information security risks. In other words, it helps you identify what could go wrong, assess the likelihood of it happening, and determine the potential impact on your organisation.

The risk management process according to **ISO 27005 includes several steps**.

First, you need to establish the context, which means **understanding your environment** and **the assets you need to protect**.

Next, you move on to **risk assessment**, which involves identifying threats and vulnerabilities, analysing the risks, and evaluating them to determine which ones need special attention.

Once you have identified and assessed the risks, **you need to decide how to treat them**. This can include actions to reduce the risks, accept them as they are, transfer them to another party (like an insurance company), or avoid them entirely. After deciding how to treat the risks, **you must officially accept the residual risks** (ISO 27005 requires you to do this explicitly).

**Communication and consultation** about risks are also key elements of ISO 27005. You need to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the risks and the actions taken to manage them.

It's crucial to **monitor and review risks regularly** to ensure that the measures in place are effective and that no new risks have emerged.

ISO 27005 follows a **continuous improvement approach** based on the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle. This means you plan and identify risks, implement the necessary actions to manage them, check the results to verify their effectiveness, and re-evaluate your strategy based on the outcomes. This approach allows for dynamic and adaptable management of information security risks.

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/ISO-27005-Cycle.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

The ISO 27005 standard is designed to be compatible with other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, which provide additional requirements and recommendations for information security. It also builds on the risk management concepts described in ISO 31000, another international standard dedicated to risk management in general.

ISO 27005 is **applicable to all types of organisations**, whether commercial enterprises, government agencies, or non-profit organisations. Regardless of size or industry, every organisation can benefit from the guidelines provided by this standard to better manage its information security risks.

Unlike ISO 27001, which can be officially certified, ISO 27005 itself is not subject to certification. However, there are training courses and professional certifications based on this standard, allowing individuals to develop their skills in information security risk management.

Since its first publication in 2008, ISO 27005 has undergone several revisions, the latest being the [ISO/IEC 27005:2022](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:27005:ed-4:v1:en) version, published in October 2022. This continuous evolution reflects changes in the information security landscape and new emerging threats.

ISO 27005 plays a crucial role in establishing an effective Information Security Management System (ISMS), as defined in ISO 27001. It enables organisations to systematically identify, assess, and manage information security risks, thereby protecting their information assets. By following ISO 27005 guidelines, organisations can not only safeguard against potential threats but also enhance their resilience to security incidents.

### The American Guide: NIST SP 800-30

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/Implementing-NIST-SP-800-30.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST SP 800-30 offers a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks that could affect operations, assets, and individuals within an organisation (as you might have guessed!).

The NIST SP 800-30 guide, last revised in September 2012, is a **critical component of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**. It is designed for use by all types of organisations, whether public or private, and applies to a wide range of information systems, from typical office networks to specialised systems used across various industries.

The risk assessment process according to NIST SP 800-30 involves several key steps.

First, you need to **prepare the assessment**. This involves defining the **objective** and **scope** of the assessment, **identifying the necessary information** and **decisions** the assessment must support, and recognising the **assumptions** and **constraints** that will influence the assessment. It's also crucial to **determine the sources of information on threats**, **vulnerabilities**, and **impacts**, and to select an appropriate **risk model** for the analysis.

Once this preparation is complete, you can **begin the actual assessment**.

The first step is to identify **threat sources**, considering their intent, capabilities, and potential targets.

Next, you need to identify **information system vulnerabilities** that these threats could exploit.

Once you've identified the threats and vulnerabilities, estimate the **likelihood of these events occurring**. Then, evaluate the **potential impacts** of these events on the organisation, including financial damage, loss of reputation, or operational disruptions.

By combining the likelihood and impact, you can **determine the overall risk level**.

After completing the risk assessment, it's essential to **communicate the results to stakeholders**. This involves documenting the results clearly and understandably, and ensuring the information is shared with decision-makers and other relevant parties within the organisation. Use the risk assessment results to inform risk management decisions and prioritise actions to be taken.

Risk assessment is not a one-time process. NIST SP 800-30 recommends **continuously monitoring** identified risks and re-evaluating them as needed to ensure that risk management measures remain effective and relevant.

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/NIST-framework.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

One of the main advantages of NIST SP 800-30 is that it provides a **common terminology for discussing risks**, making it easier for technical and non-technical stakeholders to communicate. It also offers a comprehensive and systematic framework for risk assessment, ensuring all relevant factors are considered.

To implement NIST SP 800-30 effectively, it's recommended to clearly define the objectives and scope of the risk assessment from the start, involve relevant stakeholders throughout the organisation, use appropriate tools and technologies to facilitate the assessment process, and conduct regular reviews to ensure the assessment remains current and accurate.

### The European Method: EBIOS RM

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/EBIOS-RM-Workshops.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

EBIOS-RM, or _Expression des Besoins et Identification des Objectifs de S√©curit√© - Risk Manager_ (Expression of Needs and Identification of Security Objectives - Risk Manager, in Shakespeare's language), is a **French method developed to assess and manage digital risks**. Created by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) with support from the EBIOS Club, this method offers a structured and iterative approach to managing information system risks.

The main objectives of EBIOS-RM are to identify risks affecting information systems, evaluate the severity and potential impacts of these risks, define and implement appropriate security measures to control them, and validate the acceptable risk level while following a continuous improvement approach.

It's particularly useful for establishing or strengthening a digital risk management process, assessing and managing risks related to a digital project, and defining the required security level for a product or service in the context of certifications or accreditations.

EBIOS-RM is structured around **five main workshops**, each with a specific goal.

1. The first workshop, **"Scope and Security Baseline"**, involves defining the study's scope and the security foundations. This includes understanding the organisational environment and setting security objectives.

2. The second workshop, **"Risk Sources"**, aims to identify potential risk sources. These can include internal and external threats, system vulnerabilities, and environmental or organisational factors that could affect security.

3. The third workshop, **"Strategic Scenarios"**, involves developing risk scenarios at a strategic level. The goal here is to understand the broad outlines of potential risks and how they could affect the organisation on a macro level.

4. The fourth workshop, **"Operational Scenarios"**, takes these scenarios to a more detailed and operational level. This involves examining specific risks and the pathways through which they could materialise, providing a better understanding of how threats could exploit system vulnerabilities.

5. Finally, the fifth workshop, **"Risk Treatment"**, proposes and validates security measures to address the identified risks. This involves determining the actions needed to reduce or eliminate risks and ensuring these measures are adequate and effective.

EBIOS-RM offers several advantages.

It is **adaptable**, meaning it can be adjusted based on the organisation's goals and context. It also promotes a **shared understanding of risks** between decision-makers and operational actors, facilitating collaborative risk management. Additionally, it is **compatible with international standards**, particularly ISO 27005, making it easier to adopt internationally.

However, EBIOS-RM is not without its drawbacks. The method can be perceived as complex to implement, especially for organisations with no prior risk management experience. Furthermore, evaluating the severity and impacts of risks can sometimes lack precision, being partly subjective.

### Other Methods

#### OCTAVE

The OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) method is a systematic approach to assessing and managing risks. Developed by the CERT at Carnegie Mellon University, it is particularly suited for **small and medium-sized enterprises**.

In brief, OCTAVE is divided into three main phases.

The first phase, the **organisational view**, involves identifying critical assets and potential threats, then qualitatively assessing risks and the organisation's tolerances.

The second phase, the **technical view**, involves analysing the technical infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate the potential impacts of threats on critical assets.

The third phase, **strategy development**, includes analysing combined risks (threats and vulnerabilities), prioritising risks to be addressed, and implementing appropriate security measures.

OCTAVE also offers variants, such as **OCTAVE-S** for small businesses, and **OCTAVE Allegro**, which focuses on information assets. The advantages of this method include qualitative risk assessment, promoting a security culture, employee participation, and cost reduction through targeted security controls.

#### MEHARI

The MEHARI (Method for Harmonised Analysis of Risk) method is a free and open-source approach developed by [CLUSIF](https://clusif.fr/) to assess and manage information security risks.

MEHARI follows a structured process in several steps: threat analysis, asset classification based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, risk probability and impact evaluation, and assessment of existing security measures.

MEHARI offers tools and dashboards to monitor and manage risks, aligning with ISO 27001 and 27002 standards. It combines qualitative and quantitative aspects, using specific scenarios to evaluate risks.

Adaptable to organisations of all sizes, MEHARI allows for strategic planning of security measures, although its implementation may require significant expertise and generate detailed documentation.

#### ISAMM

The ISAMM (Information Security Assessment and Monitoring Method) method is an approach developed by [Telindus N.V.](https://telindus.nl/) to assess and manage information security risks. Aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 standards, it combines qualitative and quantitative assessments.

ISAMM is divided into three main phases: scoping, assessment, and reporting.

The scoping phase identifies and values the organisation's assets, selects relevant threats, and determines necessary security controls.

The assessment phase measures compliance with ISO/IEC 27002 controls, estimates compliance costs, and calculates threat probabilities and impacts.

The reporting phase generates risk reduction simulations, develops a risk treatment plan, and produces detailed reports.

#### FAIR

The FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) method is a quantitative approach to assessing and managing information security risks.

Developed by Jack Jones, it helps organisations translate risks into financial terms, facilitating decision-making for executives. FAIR stands out for its ability to quantify risks and break them down into basic elements for detailed analysis.

The method is divided into four main phases: identifying risk scenarios, evaluating risk factors, analysing data, and managing risks. It starts by identifying critical assets and potential threats, then evaluates event frequency and potential financial impact. The collected data is modelled to estimate loss frequency and magnitude distributions.

To choose between ISO 27005, NIST SP 800-30, and EBIOS-RM, consider your company's context.

If you want a widely recognised standard integrated with other ISO standards, go for ISO 27005, ideal for organisations with existing risk management processes.

For a highly detailed approach, choose NIST SP 800-30, though it can be complex without a good understanding of NIST standards.

Finally, if you prefer an agile and collaborative method, particularly in France, EBIOS-RM is flexible and ideal for involving various stakeholders, requiring good coordination and specific training.

## Comparing Approaches

### Qualitative vs Quantitative Approaches

<img src="https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M02-Risk_Management_and_Network_Security_(Purple)/D02-Security_Audits_and_Governance/01-lectures/Quantitative-Qualitative-Approaches.png" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '500px', margin: '0 auto',}} />

To assess and manage these risks, two main approaches are used: the qualitative approach and the quantitative approach.

Each approach has its own methods, advantages, and disadvantages, and they are often used together to get a more comprehensive view of risks.

The **qualitative** approach focuses on the subjective evaluation of risks. It relies on techniques such as questionnaires, collaborative workshops, risk matrices, and expert opinions. This method uses descriptors like "low," "medium," or "high" to assess the likelihood and impact of risks.

However, the qualitative approach has its **limitations**. Evaluations are based on subjective judgments rather than numerical data, which can lead to some inaccuracy. Additionally, this method may be less effective for assessing complex risks that require detailed analyses.

The **quantitative** approach, on the other hand, is more objective and relies on numerical data and statistical analyses. It uses mathematical models to quantify risks in terms of probability and financial impact. For example, an organisation can use historical data on security incidents to estimate the likelihood of certain threats occurring and the associated costs.

It is often beneficial to use both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative assessments allow for rapid identification and prioritisation of risks, while quantitative assessments provide the detailed and precise analyses needed for strategic decisions and budget justifications.

For instance, an organisation might start with a qualitative assessment to identify and prioritise the main risks. Then, it can use a quantitative approach to analyse the most critical risks in more detail and develop mitigation plans based on numerical data.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Approach

| **Aspect**        | **Qualitative Approach**                                         | **Quantitative Approach**                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**        | Subjective                                                       | Objective                                                           |
| **Methodology**   | Expert opinions, questionnaires, risk matrices                   | Statistical models, simulations, historical data                    |
| **Time and Cost** | Quick and inexpensive                                            | Can be time-consuming and costly                                    |
| **Accuracy**      | Less precise, based on descriptors                               | Highly precise, based on numerical values                           |
| **Usage**         | Initial assessment, rapid risk identification and prioritisation | Detailed analysis, financial impact assessment, strategic decisions |
| **Participation** | Broad, including non-experts                                     | Often limited to security and statistical experts                   |

One of the main advantages of the qualitative approach is its **simplicity and speed**. This method is generally faster and easier to implement, especially when quantitative data is insufficient or hard to obtain.

Additionally, the qualitative approach allows for **broad participation**. By involving various stakeholders within the organisation, including those who are not IT security experts, this method can enrich the understanding of risks.

The main advantage of the quantitative approach is its **objectivity and precision**. Quantitative assessments provide accurate and measurable results, allowing for a more rigorous comparison of risks.

However, the quantitative approach can be **complex and costly** to implement. This method requires detailed data and often demands expertise in statistics and modelling. Moreover, data collection and analysis can consume significant time and resources.

Another advantage of the quantitative approach is the ability to perform **cost-benefit analyses**. This helps evaluate risk mitigation options and make informed decisions at the management level. For instance, an organisation can compare the costs of different security measures with the expected benefits in terms of risk reduction.

## Key Steps Of Risk Management

As a cybersecurity consultant, there are key steps to follow for managing risks.

The first step is to **identify the company's assets**, such as data, software, hardware, cloud resources, communication channels, paper records, and physical locations. Next, you need to **classify** and **value** these assets using security criteria like availability, integrity, confidentiality, and traceability, each rated on a scale from low to very high.

Once you've identified and classified the assets, it's important to understand their **interdependencies**. Mapping these dependencies helps assess the potential impacts in case of a compromise.

To **assess threats and vulnerabilities**, analyse logs and network traffic using SIEM tools to detect abnormal behaviour or intrusion attempts. Use previous audit reports to identify recurring attacks and evaluate the security posture with automated assessment tools, penetration tests, and anomaly detection systems.

**Vulnerability scans and audits** are essential for identifying security weaknesses. Tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys can be used for regular scans, complemented by manual scans for in-depth analysis. Configuration, code, and compliance audits verify security and adherence to standards.

**Risk matrices** help visualise risks based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact. By defining these scales and assessing each risk, you can place them in the matrix to identify those needing immediate attention.

Finally, develop **risk treatment plans** that include prevention, detection, response, and recovery measures. Then the risks can be accepted, transferred, reduced, or avoided based on the company's risk appetite.

**Risk management process is a cycle** that requires continuous monitoring and improvement. Regularly review the risk management strategy, update the risk register, and communicate with stakeholders to ensure everyone is aware of the risks and the actions taken to manage them.
