# Get prepared for your bootcamp

Welcome to Jedha's cybersecurity fullstack program!

You are about to start a very intense and exciting journey. To make sure you get the most out of it, we have prepared a list of things you should do before starting your bootcamp.

## What machine should I use during my bootcamp? ðŸ’»

Let's start with the basics: your machine.

If you are following this program, we assume that you already have a bit of knowledge about it. Therefore, we definitely don't mind about which Operating System you use:

- Windows âœ…
- Mac âœ…
- Linux âœ…

However don't use too "simple" OS like Chromebooks that will prevent you from being able to install anything on it.

In addition to that, here is a piece of advice on some recommended specs for your machine:

- Minimum 8Go RAM - (16Go would be ideal)
- Minimum 50Go of usable storage - (75Go is ideal)
- Minimum processor Intel Core i5 - (Intel Core i7 is ideal)

## How much time should I allocate for my prep-work?

It totally depends on where are now. At least, you should **allocate 5 hours** to review and strengthen your knowledge on the concepts we listed below.

## What to install? ðŸ§°

To start your bootcamp on the right foot, you need to prepare your local environment and to do so, you will need to proceed to some installations (if you haven't done them already). We are using Kali Linux as our main operating system for this course so we encourage you to install it on your machine either locally or in a virtual machine. We recommend you to use a virtual machine as it will be easier to manage and you will be able to use your main operating system at the same time.

Once your hacking environment is set up, we will setup some other tools such as Docker.

### Kali Linux

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Kali contains several hundred tools which are geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering. Kali Linux is developed, funded and maintained by Offensive Security, a leading information security training company.

Depending on your machine you can use several hyper-visors to install Kali Linux. We recommend you to use VirtualBox as it is free and easy to use. You can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). It is available for Windows, GNU/Linux, Solaris, BSD-based and Mac OS systems.

You can also use VMWare Workstation Player which is also free for non-commercial use. You can download it [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).

If you are on MacOS Silicon (M1, M2 or M3), you can use UTM which is a free and open-source virtual machine solution. You can download it [here](https://mac.getutm.app/).

Once your hypervisor is installed, you can download the Kali Linux ISO [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/). Look for the installer corresponding to your architecture (32 or 64 bits) and your hypervisor (VirtualBox, VMWare, UTM, etc.).

### The Jedha CLI

We will use the Jedha CLI in order to start and stop the labs. A lab is a practical environment, running on your own machine, that offers you a secure environment to practice your skills. Follow the instructions [here](https://app.jedha.co/track/learn-to-use-the-jedha-cli) to install and learn how to use the Jedha CLI.

<Note type="note">
We recommend to install the Jedha CLI on your Kali Linux machine. We do not insure the compatibility of the Jedha CLI with other operating systems.
</Note>

### Docker

Install Docker on Kali Linux by following the instructions [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/installing-docker-on-kali/#installing-docker-ce-on-kali-linux).

<Note type="note">

If for some reasons you can't install one of the above tool on your own, it's okay. Reach out to Jedha's team on Discord and we'll help you!

</Note>

## Now what prep-work should I do?

Let's get right to it! To prepare your bootcamp, you should feel comfortable with (by decreasing order of importance):

- Python programming basics
- Shell commands and bash scripting
- Docker

Now to help you go through your preparation, we have prepared a list of ressources (either from Jedha or external resources) that you can follow.

### Python programming basics

- [Introduction to python for data science](https://app.jedha.co/track/introduction-to-python-for-data-science): *yes*, this course is for data-science but it will give you a good introduction to python programming.
- [Beginner's guide to python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)

### Shell commands and bash scripting

Shell is about mastering your terminal commands. You should know how to nagivate within your computer no matter your Operating System. At least, you should know about linux system as it's the basis of all production server:

- [Bash unleash the power of the command line](https://app.jedha.co/track/bash-unleash-the-power-of-the-command-line)
- [Shell scripting basics](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/hands-on-introduction-to-linux-commands-and-shell-scripting/shell-scripting-basics-9xMbm?redirectTo=%2Flearn%2Fhands-on-introduction-to-linux-commands-and-shell-scripting%3Faction%3Denroll)
- [Introduction to Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-powershell/)

### Docker

- [Official Docker 101 tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/)
- [Docker Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana)

Happy coding and see you on the first day of your bootcamp! ðŸ˜˜
