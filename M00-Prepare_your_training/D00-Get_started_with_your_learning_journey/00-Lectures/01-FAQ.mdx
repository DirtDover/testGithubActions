# Frequently Asked Questions

- **How do I use Discord? 👾**

Discord is our communication tool! This is where you will find your cohort’s channel, and various general channels where you can speak with other students, alumni, see the latest job offers and events 🎙

You first need to access our [#general](https://discord.gg/Z8uwdB7MUb) channel, briefly present yourself (who you are, in which session you are a part of…) and then you’re in!

Please have a look at the pinned messages on each channel as they will give you some information and rules about each channel.

- **What tools or softwares do I need to set up before the course? 📀**

To be properly set up for your Data Fullstack course, you will need:

1. Kali linux on VM (or on premise, as you wish)
2. Docker

- **Where can I find the solutions for each exercise? 👩🏼‍💻**

Once you validated your exercise, you will be able to access the solution by clicking on the `Solution` button on the top right corner of the exercise.

- **I have forgotten to sign an attendance sheet on Edusign, what do I do? 😱**

Your teacher will send you an attendance sheet to sign for every half day. If you missed one, no worries! Attendance sheets are very important to sign, especially if you enrolled with a public funding organization, or your company funded your training, but you will be reminded by email the following day with a link to sign ✍🏽

- **I would like to give some insights/remarks about the course 💌**

And we’d love to have your feedback! At the end of every module, you will receive an email asking you to rate from 0 to 5 the module you have just finished. You can add a comment to your rating to give us insights about the content, your instructor, Jedha in general…

On the last day of your training, you will receive an email asking you to rate your general experience from 0 to 10. This one is very important for us!

_If you need to talk about something that requires more assistance from us, please contact us on Discord or on `program@jedha.co`._
