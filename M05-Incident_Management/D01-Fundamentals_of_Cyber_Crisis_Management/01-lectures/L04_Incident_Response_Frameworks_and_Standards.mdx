# Frameworks & Standards: NIST, SANS, ISO 27035

Understanding and implementing standards and frameworks for incident management is essential for an effective incident response strategy. These standards provide structured guidelines and best practices to help organizations prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

## Main Incident Management Standards and Frameworks

### [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a comprehensive guideline designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**. Each function includes categories and subcategories that cover a wide range of cybersecurity activities and best practices. NIST provides detailed guidance on incident response through its Special Publication 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide", which outlines steps for incident handling and offers practical recommendations for each phase of the incident response lifecycle.

### [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security)

The **SANS Institute** offers a widely recognized Incident Handlers Handbook that provides practical advice for handling security incidents. This handbook emphasizes a six-step approach: **Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned**. The SANS framework focuses on actionable steps that can be implemented by incident response teams to manage and mitigate incidents effectively. It is particularly useful for organizations looking for a hands-on, practical approach to incident response.

### [ISO 27035](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/78973.html)

**ISO 27035** is an international standard for information security incident management. It provides a structured approach to handling incidents, including the planning, detection, assessment, response, and learning stages. ISO 27035 emphasizes the importance of having a well-documented incident response plan and continuous improvement through lessons learned. It helps organizations establish a systematic process for managing information security incidents, ensuring that they can respond effectively to any threats.

There is also other ISO Standards that will help you during your Cyber Crisis:

- [ISO 27010](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/68427.html): Guidance for Information Security Management for Inter-sector Communications
- [ISO 27032](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/76070.html): Guidelines for Cybersecurity
- [ISO 27037](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/44381.html): Evidence Acquisition Procedure for Digital Forensics
- [ISO 29147](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/72311.html): Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

## Comparison and Practical Application of These Standards

### Comparison

**NIST's framework** is highly comprehensive, providing a broad overview of cybersecurity risk management and incident response. It is widely used in various industries and is particularly beneficial for organizations looking for a detailed and structured approach to cybersecurity.

While the **SANS framework** is more practical and hands-on, making it suitable for organizations that need actionable steps and immediate guidance on handling incidents. It is highly regarded for its focus on real-world application and ease of implementation.

Finally, **ISO 27035** provides a global standard that emphasizes the need for a formalized and systematic approach to incident management. It is ideal for organizations that require a standardized process and need to comply with international regulations and best practices.

### Practical Application

First, organizations should assess their current incident response capabilities and identify gaps or areas for improvement. Based on this assessment, they can **select the most appropriate framework or a combination of frameworks** to guide their incident response strategy.

For instance, an organization might use **NIST**'s detailed guidelines to establish a comprehensive incident response plan while applying **SANS**'s practical steps for day-to-day incident handling. **ISO 27035** can be integrated to ensure that the organization meets international standards and continuously improves its incident response process.

In practice, organizations should develop and document their incident response plans according to the chosen framework(s). This includes **defining roles and responsibilities**, establishing communication protocols, and outlining specific procedures for each phase of the incident response lifecycle.

Regular training and drills should be conducted to ensure that all team members are familiar with the incident response plan and can execute it effectively. Continuous monitoring, assessment, and improvement are essential to keep the incident response capabilities aligned with evolving threats and organizational changes.
