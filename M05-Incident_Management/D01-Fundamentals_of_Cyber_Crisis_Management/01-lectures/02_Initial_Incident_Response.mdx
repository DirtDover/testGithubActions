# Initial Incident Response

## Detection and Notification

In incident response, detecting and notifying about security incidents quickly and efficiently is crucial.

### Incident Detection Methods

Effective incident response begins with the ability to quickly detect and notify relevant stakeholders about security incidents. Leveraging the right tools and techniques ensures a prompt and organized reaction to potential threats. Here’s a guide to the essential tools and methods used in incident detection and notification, along with how they interconnect to enhance overall security response. To detect security incidents, various tools and methods can be employed such as:

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** like **Snort**, **Suricata**, and **Zeek** monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. These tools analyze patterns and generate alerts when anomalies are detected. This initial detection is crucial for identifying potential threats early on.

- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**, including **Cisco Firepower** and **Palo Alto Networks**, build upon IDS capabilities by not only detecting but also automatically blocking malicious activities. This integration helps to stop threats before they can cause significant damage.

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solutions like **Splunk**, **IBM QRadar**, and **Wazuh** aggregate and analyze log data from various sources. By correlating data across different systems, SIEM tools provide a broader view of potential incidents and help prioritize responses.

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** tools, such as **CrowdStrike**, **Carbon Black**, and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, monitor activities on individual endpoints. These tools offer real-time detection and response capabilities, allowing for quick action against threats on devices like laptops and servers.

- **Vulnerability Scanners** like **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **Qualys** proactively identify weaknesses in systems and applications that could be exploited by attackers. Regular scans help in patching vulnerabilities before they are targeted.

- **Log Monitoring** through platforms like **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) enables detailed analysis of system and network logs. This helps in detecting patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security incident.

- **Honeypots**, like **Honeyd** and **Modern Honey Network (MHN)**, serve as decoy systems designed to attract and monitor attackers. These honeypots can be deployed either internally within an organization's network or externally on the internet. However, if an internal honeypot detects malicious activity, it indicates a more severe breach, as it suggests that an attacker has already penetrated the organization's defenses.

### Notification and Escalation Process

Once an incident is detected, promptly notifying the relevant parties and escalating the incident as needed is critical for effective incident response. Utilizing various tools and techniques can significantly enhance this process.

**Incident Management Systems**, such as ServiceNow, JIRA Service Desk, and PagerDuty, are essential for tracking and managing incidents from detection through resolution. While these tools are commonly used, organizations can also leverage their existing ticketing systems within their Configuration Management (CM) framework. These systems, whether specialized or integrated into the broader CM tools, ensure that all actions are documented and that the appropriate personnel are alerted promptly. They provide a centralized platform for incident documentation, ensuring every step is recorded and traceable, which is crucial for post-incident analysis and continuous improvement.

**Clear playbooks and procedures outline** the steps to respond to various types of incidents, including specific escalation procedures. These documents specify when and to whom an incident should be escalated, ensuring that responses are timely and appropriate. By having predefined protocols, organizations can ensure that incidents are handled consistently and effectively, reducing response times and minimizing confusion during an incident.

**Automated alerts** set up in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools notify security teams through emails, SMS, or mobile notifications. This real-time alerting mechanism ensures that the response team is aware of incidents as soon as they occur, allowing for immediate action. Rapid notification is crucial for containing and mitigating the impact of incidents.

**Real-time communication tools**, such as Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or Mattermost, are essential for coordinating among team members during an incident. However, it's crucial to use communication channels that are different from the usual ones to avoid potential compromise. Before using these tools, ensure they are secure and not already compromised by the ongoing threat. Effective communication is key for quick decision-making and collaboration, so verifying the integrity and security of these platforms is vital to maintaining situational awareness and coordinating a cohesive and effective response.

## Initial Assessment

The initial assessment phase is crucial for effectively managing a security incident. It involves evaluating the incident’s impact and scope, defining its boundaries, and classifying its nature. This structured approach ensures a focused and efficient response.

### Impact and Scope Assessment

First, the impact assessment involves looking at how the incident disrupts operations, affects data integrity, and influences overall security. You need to assess which specific systems, applications, or data have been compromised or disrupted. Consider the business impact by evaluating potential financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Additionally, it is essential to identify any regulatory or compliance issues that may arise, such as obligations for data breach notifications.

Following the impact assessment, the scope of the incident must be determined. This involves mapping out which systems and networks are affected and understanding how the incident spread within the organization. It’s important to identify whether the incident is localized or has broader implications. This will help in containing the threat and focusing response efforts on the most critical areas.

### Scope Definition

Defining the scope of the incident involves setting clear boundaries to focus the response efforts. This means specifying the exact areas of the organization that are impacted. Start by identifying which departments, systems, applications, and data are involved. This helps in understanding the extent of the damage and prevents further spread of the incident.

To manage the scope effectively, immediate containment measures should be implemented. This may involve isolating affected systems, disconnecting them from the network, or restricting access to certain resources. Communicating with relevant stakeholders about the incident’s scope is also crucial, as it ensures that everyone affected is informed and can take necessary actions to mitigate the issue.

### Incident Classification

Classifying a cybersecurity incident is essential for determining the appropriate response strategy and efficiently allocating resources. This process involves categorizing the incident based on its nature, severity, and potential impact, and is crucial for ensuring that the response is both effective and proportionate to the threat. Utilizing established frameworks and standards helps maintain consistency and a systematic approach.

The **National Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS)** offers a standardized method for evaluating the severity of a cyber incident. It considers factors such as the scope of impact, the sophistication of the attack, and the potential harm it could cause. By assigning a score that reflects the incident's severity, organizations can ensure uniformity in their assessments and make informed decisions about the necessary response.

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** is another valuable resource, providing guidelines for managing and reducing cybersecurity risk. Within its incident response lifecycle, incident classification plays a key role. The NIST framework encourages a comprehensive approach, taking into account threat intelligence, the nature of the attack, and the potential organizational impact to ensure an effective and thorough classification process.

**Impact-based classification** is another method that focuses on assessing the potential operational, financial, and reputational damage of an incident. By evaluating how an incident could disrupt business continuity and cause significant losses, this approach helps organizations prioritize incidents based on their potential severity. This method ensures that the most critical incidents receive immediate attention, helping to minimize damage and recovery time.

In summary, classifying a cybersecurity incident requires a multi-faceted approach that considers both the technical details of the attack and its broader implications for the organization. By combining standardized frameworks like NCISS and NIST with impact-based assessment, organizations can ensure that their response is appropriate to the threat level and aligned with their overall risk management strategy.

## Triggering Response Plans

With a comprehensive initial assessment completed, the next step is to trigger the appropriate response plans. This involves mobilizing the incident response team, activating predefined response procedures, and deploying resources to address the incident effectively.

The first action is to activate the incident response plan that corresponds to the classification and severity of the incident. This plan outlines specific steps for containment, eradication, and recovery based on the incident type and impact. Ensure that the response team is assembled, including relevant stakeholders such as IT, security, legal, and communications personnel.

As you implement the response plan, maintain clear and continuous communication with all involved parties. Provide updates on the incident’s status, response actions, and any changes in strategy. This helps in coordinating efforts and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the overall response objectives.

Additionally, monitor the effectiveness of the response actions and adjust the plan as necessary based on new information or developments. This ongoing evaluation helps in refining the approach and improving the response to address the incident more effectively.

Finally, document all actions taken during the response, including decisions, communications, and changes to the strategy. This documentation is essential for post-incident analysis, reporting, and future improvements to the incident response process.
