# Incident Notification

## Legal and Regulatory Obligations

In the realm of incident response, understanding and complying with legal and regulatory obligations is crucial. These obligations ensure that organizations handle incidents properly and maintain compliance with laws and standards. Here, we delve into the key regulatory requirements, including the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**, and specific obligations under the French data protection authority, **CNIL**. Additionally, we will discuss the equivalent authority in the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**.

### Notification Requirements under the GDPR

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** mandates strict requirements for notifying data breaches. Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach involving personal data. This notification should include details such as the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

If the breach poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, organizations must also inform the affected data subjects without undue delay. This communication should be clear and concise, providing advice on how individuals can protect themselves and what steps the organization is taking to mitigate the breach's impact.

### Entities

Different regulatory bodies and standards have specific requirements and oversight. Under GDPR, each EU member state has its own supervisory authority responsible for enforcing the regulation. In France, the **Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)** serves this role. And if we change continents, in the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** oversees the enforcement of data privacy and security regulations, particularly focusing on protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive practices.

For the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**, organizations handling payment card data must comply with requirements to protect cardholder data and report breaches to relevant entities, including card brands and acquiring banks. PCI DSS applies to any entity that stores, processes, or transmits payment card data.

### PCI DSS

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** sets forth security standards to protect payment card information. Organizations subject to PCI DSS must implement a robust security framework, including measures for detecting and responding to breaches. In the event of a breach, organizations must notify their acquiring bank and relevant card brands immediately. Failure to comply with PCI DSS can result in significant fines and penalties, as well as damage to the organization’s reputation.

### Obligations Specific to the CNIL

The **CNIL**, France’s data protection authority, imposes additional obligations on organizations operating within its jurisdiction. When a data breach occurs, organizations must notify the CNIL within 72 hours, providing detailed information about the breach. The CNIL may require further information or specific actions to mitigate the breach's impact.

The CNIL also emphasizes the importance of documenting the breach and the response efforts. Organizations should maintain detailed records of the incident, including the timeline of events, the nature of the breach, and the steps taken to address it. These records can be crucial for compliance reviews and audits.

### Obligations Specific to the FTC

In the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** requires organizations to implement reasonable security measures to protect consumer data. In the event of a data breach, organizations must notify affected individuals, law enforcement, and in some cases, the FTC itself. The FTC can take enforcement actions against companies that fail to adequately protect consumer data or properly report breaches.

### Filing a Complaint

Filing a complaint involves reporting a security incident to law enforcement authorities. Organizations should document the incident thoroughly, including evidence of the breach, the affected systems, and the response measures taken. This documentation supports the complaint and aids law enforcement in their investigation.

In the United States, breaches involving personal data may need to be reported to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which can lead to investigations and potential enforcement actions. Additionally, significant cyber incidents can be reported to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which handles cybercrime complaints and coordinates with other federal agencies for investigation and response. For incidents involving national security, organizations should contact the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

In France, organizations should report breaches to the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI), which provides guidance and assistance in handling cybersecurity incidents. If the incident involves personal data breaches, it must be reported to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), which oversees data protection and privacy regulations.

When filing a complaint, it is important to gather and present all relevant evidence in an organized manner. This includes logs, emails, and any other documentation that can help authorities understand the nature and scope of the breach. Providing a clear timeline of events and detailing the steps taken in response to the breach can also be beneficial. This organized presentation of evidence aids in the thorough investigation and resolution of the incident.

### Notification Process to the CNIL, FTC, and Other Authorities

When notifying the **CNIL**, **FTC**, and other authorities about a breach, organizations must follow specific stages to ensure effective communication and compliance. The notification process typically involves several stages.

First, identify and assess the breach to understand its scope and impact. Next, notify the relevant authorities, providing all required information within the mandated timeframe. This includes details about the breach, affected individuals, and response measures. After initial notification, organizations should remain in contact with the authorities, providing updates as new information becomes available. Continuous communication helps ensure transparency and demonstrates the organization’s commitment to resolving the issue.

Effective notification involves clear and concise communication. Organizations should prepare detailed incident reports that include all necessary information without overwhelming the authorities with unnecessary details. Using a structured format can help ensure that all relevant information is included.

It is also important to designate a point of contact within the organization who can handle communications with the authorities. This person should be knowledgeable about the incident and the organization’s response efforts, ensuring consistent and accurate information is provided.

Maintaining detailed records of all communications with authorities is crucial. These records support compliance efforts and can be useful in future audits or investigations.

By understanding and adhering to legal and regulatory obligations, organizations can ensure that they handle security incidents appropriately, maintain compliance, and protect their reputation.
