# Frameworks & Standards: NIST, SANS, ISO 27035

Understanding and implementing standards and frameworks for incident management is essential for an effective incident response strategy. These standards provide structured guidelines and best practices to help organizations prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

## Main Incident Management Standards and Frameworks

### [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a comprehensive guideline designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**. Each function includes categories and subcategories that cover a wide range of cybersecurity activities and best practices. NIST provides detailed guidance on incident response through its Special Publication 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide", which outlines steps for incident handling and offers practical recommendations for each phase of the incident response lifecycle.

### [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security)

The **SANS Institute** offers a widely recognized Incident Handlers Handbook that provides practical advice for handling security incidents. This handbook emphasizes a six-step approach: **Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned**. The SANS framework focuses on actionable steps that can be implemented by incident response teams to manage and mitigate incidents effectively. In addition to the handbook, SANS also certifies professionals in incident handling and response. Although these certifications can be expensive, they are highly regarded in the industry for their rigorous standards and comprehensive training, making them a valuable credential for those seeking to enhance their expertise in cybersecurity incident management.

### [ISO 27035](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/78973.html)

**ISO 27035** is an international standard for information security incident management. It provides a structured approach to handling incidents, including the planning, detection, assessment, response, and learning stages. ISO 27035 emphasizes the importance of having a well-documented incident response plan and continuous improvement through lessons learned. It helps organizations establish a systematic process for managing information security incidents, ensuring that they can respond effectively to any threats.

There is also other ISO Standards that will help you during your Cyber Crisis:

- [ISO 27010](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/68427.html): Guidance for Information Security Management for Inter-sector Communications
- [ISO 27032](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/76070.html): Guidelines for Cybersecurity
- [ISO 27037](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/44381.html): Evidence Acquisition Procedure for Digital Forensics
- [ISO 29147](https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/72311.html): Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

## Comparison and Practical Application of These Standards

### Comparison

The **NIST framework** is known for its comprehensive and in-depth approach to cybersecurity risk management and incident response. It provides detailed guidelines for organizations to follow, making it ideal for those looking for a structured, systematic approach to managing cybersecurity risks across various industries. Its thoroughness makes it well-suited for organizations that require a broad overview and strong governance around incident response.

On the other hand, the **SANS framework** is highly practical and hands-on, providing organizations with actionable steps to address incidents quickly and efficiently. This framework is favored for its focus on real-world scenarios and its ease of implementation, making it a strong choice for organizations that prioritize rapid response and operational effectiveness.

Finally, **ISO 27035** offers a globally recognized standard that emphasizes the need for a formalized, systematic approach to incident response. It is particularly beneficial for organizations operating in multiple countries or industries that require adherence to international regulations and best practices. The ISO framework is ideal for those seeking consistency and compliance with recognized global standards.

| **Framework** | **Approach**                 | **Strengths**                                           | **Ideal For**                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NIST**      | Comprehensive and structured | Detailed guidance for cybersecurity risk management     | Organizations needing a thorough, industry-agnostic framework      |
| **SANS**      | Practical and hands-on       | Focus on real-world application and ease of use         | Organizations needing immediate, actionable steps                  |
| **ISO 27035** | Standardized and systematic  | International standardization and regulatory compliance | Organizations requiring formalized processes and global compliance |

### Practical Application

Successfully implementing an incident response framework in a professional setting involves more than simply selecting a methodology. It requires careful integration into the organization's broader ecosystem, ensuring that every department, process, and employee is aligned and prepared. Below are the key steps for embedding incident response frameworks into the operational fabric of an organization, making sure that the response is swift, efficient, and compliant with industry standards.

#### Cross-Functional Collaboration

Effective incident response requires collaboration across multiple departments, not just the IT or cybersecurity teams. Legal, human resources, and public relations must all be involved in the process. For instance, the legal team ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, while the PR team manages external communications to mitigate reputational damage. **NIST** can be used to define clear roles and responsibilities for each department, ensuring a coordinated effort during an incident.

#### Integration with Existing Processes

Incident response frameworks should be embedded within the organization’s existing workflows rather than being treated as standalone processes. **SANS** provides actionable steps that can be incorporated into daily operations, such as creating playbooks for common incidents like phishing attacks or ransomware. This ensures the response process is seamless and becomes a natural extension of the organization’s standard practices.

#### Standardization and Compliance

For organizations that operate in regulated industries or across multiple regions, ensuring compliance with international standards is essential. **ISO 27035** provides the structure to create a standardized incident response plan that aligns with regulatory requirements. This helps avoid legal penalties and ensures uniformity in the response process, regardless of the type or location of the incident.

#### Regular Training and Simulations

Regular training and simulations are critical for ensuring that the response plan can be executed effectively. **SANS**' practical guidance is especially useful for running tabletop exercises or simulations that test the organization’s preparedness for various types of incidents. These drills help identify gaps in the plan, ensure team members are familiar with their roles, and enhance the organization’s overall readiness.

#### Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops

Post-incident reviews and annual audits are essential for refining and improving the incident response process. After each incident, a post-mortem analysis should be conducted to identify what worked and what didn’t. **ISO 27035** encourages continuous improvement through monitoring and feedback, helping organizations adapt to evolving threats and optimize their response over time.
