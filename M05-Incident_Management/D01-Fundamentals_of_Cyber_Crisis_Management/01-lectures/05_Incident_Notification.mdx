# Incident Notification

## Legal and Regulatory Obligations

In the realm of incident response, understanding and complying with legal and regulatory obligations is crucial. These obligations ensure that organizations handle incidents properly and maintain compliance with laws and standards. Here, we delve into the key regulatory requirements, including the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**, and specific obligations under the French data protection authority, **CNIL**. Additionally, we will discuss the equivalent authority in the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**.

### Notification Requirements under the GDPR

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** mandates strict requirements for notifying data breaches. Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach involving personal data. This notification should include details such as the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

If the breach poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, organizations must also inform the affected data subjects without undue delay. This communication should be clear and concise, providing advice on how individuals can protect themselves and what steps the organization is taking to mitigate the breach's impact.

### Entities

Different regulatory bodies and standards have specific requirements and oversight. Under GDPR, each EU member state has its own supervisory authority responsible for enforcing the regulation. In France, the **Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)** serves this role. And if we change continents, in the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** oversees the enforcement of data privacy and security regulations, particularly focusing on protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive practices.

For the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**, organizations handling payment card data must comply with requirements to protect cardholder data and report breaches to relevant entities, including card brands and acquiring banks. PCI DSS applies to any entity that stores, processes, or transmits payment card data.

### PCI DSS

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** sets forth security standards to protect payment card information. Organizations subject to PCI DSS must implement a robust security framework, including measures for detecting and responding to breaches. In the event of a breach, organizations must notify their acquiring bank and relevant card brands immediately. Failure to comply with PCI DSS can result in significant fines and penalties, as well as damage to the organization’s reputation.

### Obligations Specific to the CNIL

The **CNIL**, France’s data protection authority, imposes additional obligations on organizations operating within its jurisdiction. When a data breach occurs, organizations must notify the CNIL within 72 hours on the following [link](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/notifier-une-violation-de-donnees-personnelles), providing detailed information about the breach. The CNIL may require further information or specific actions to mitigate the breach's impact.

The CNIL also emphasizes the importance of documenting the breach and the response efforts. Organizations should maintain detailed records of the incident, including the timeline of events, the nature of the breach, and the steps taken to address it. These records can be crucial for compliance reviews and audits.

### Obligations Specific to the FTC

In the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** requires organizations to implement reasonable security measures to protect consumer data. In the event of a data breach, businesses must notify the affected individuals, law enforcement, and, in some cases, the FTC itself. This responsibility extends beyond just informing individuals; businesses must also follow a structured process to ensure all relevant parties are promptly informed, thus mitigating potential harm.

When a data breach occurs, companies are required to notify several appropriate entities:

- **Notify law enforcement**: Immediately report the incident to your local police department and emphasize the potential risks, such as identity theft. If local authorities are unfamiliar with investigating information breaches, organizations can escalate the case to federal agencies like the **FBI**, the **U.S. Secret Service**, or, in cases involving mail theft, the **U.S. Postal Inspection Service**.
- **Notify affected businesses**: If account information like credit card or bank details has been compromised, businesses must notify the institutions managing these accounts. If personal information is collected on behalf of other companies, these businesses must also be alerted.

- **Notify individuals**: Promptly inform individuals whose data has been compromised. Early notification enables them to take actions that may prevent misuse of their personal information. Depending on the breach's nature and scale, businesses may need to coordinate with law enforcement on the timing of these notifications to avoid obstructing investigations.

Organizations must also determine their legal obligations under both **state and federal laws**. All U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Additionally, specific laws such as the **FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule** or the **HIPAA Breach Notification Rule** may apply, depending on the type of data compromised, like electronic personal health records.

For breaches involving **Social Security numbers**, it is recommended to contact the major credit bureaus **Equifax**, **Experian**, and **TransUnion** to assist affected individuals with fraud alerts or credit freezes. Providing guidance on how individuals can protect themselves, such as offering free credit monitoring or identity restoration services, is strongly advised to help mitigate the impact of the breach.

Finally, businesses are expected to continuously engage with affected parties, ensuring clear communication on updates and recovery steps while complying with all applicable legal and regulatory obligations.

### Filing a Complaint

Filing a complaint involves reporting a security incident to law enforcement authorities. Organizations should document the incident thoroughly, including evidence of the breach, the affected systems, and the response measures taken. This documentation supports the complaint and aids law enforcement in their investigation.

**In the United States**, breaches involving personal data may need to be reported to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which can lead to investigations and potential enforcement actions. Additionally, significant cyber incidents can be reported to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which handles cybercrime complaints and coordinates with other federal agencies for investigation and response. For incidents involving national security, organizations should contact the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

**In France**, organizations should report breaches to the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI), which provides guidance and assistance in handling cybersecurity incidents. If the incident involves personal data breaches, it must be reported to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), which oversees data protection and privacy regulations.

When filing a complaint, it is important to gather and present all relevant evidence in an organized manner. This includes logs, emails, and any other documentation that can help authorities understand the nature and scope of the breach. Providing a clear timeline of events and detailing the steps taken in response to the breach can also be beneficial. This organized presentation of evidence aids in the thorough investigation and resolution of the incident.

### Notification Process to the CNIL, FTC, and Other Authorities

When organizations experience a data breach, they are legally obligated to notify the appropriate data protection authorities within strict timelines. The process differs depending on the jurisdiction, but the key elements involve identifying the breach, evaluating its impact, notifying authorities, and maintaining ongoing communication. Below is a detailed breakdown of the notification processes for the **CNIL**, **FTC**, and other relevant authorities.

It is also crucial to provide only the information that you are certain about when making a breach notification. Providing inaccurate or speculative details can undermine the credibility of your report and complicate the breach management process. Ensure that all reported information is thoroughly verified before submission to the authorities and affected individuals. If some details are not yet available, clearly state this and commit to providing updates as they become accessible. Accurate and transparent communication is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring effective resolution of the breach.

#### 1. Notification Process to the CNIL (France)

The **Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)** is the French data protection authority responsible for enforcing data privacy regulations under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. The CNIL has a specific protocol for notifying data breaches that organizations must adhere to.

- **Step 1: Identifying and Assessing the Breach**
    As soon as a breach is detected, the organization must assess its scope, the types of personal data involved, and the potential impact on affected individuals. This assessment helps determine the severity of the breach and whether it must be reported to the CNIL. Under **Article 33 of the GDPR**, if the breach poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the organization must notify the CNIL within **72 hours**.

- **Step 2: Initial Notification to the CNIL**
    The breach notification must include the following details:

    - Nature of the data breach (e.g., unauthorized access, data leak, etc.)
    - Categories and approximate number of individuals affected
    - Categories and approximate number of personal data records affected
    - Consequences of the breach (potential impact on affected individuals)
    - Measures taken or proposed to address the breach (e.g., security enhancements, data recovery efforts)
    - Contact details for the organization’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) or relevant representative.

    If the full details of the breach are not available within 72 hours, organizations must submit the initial notification with the available information and follow up with additional details later.

- **Step 3: Communication with Affected Individuals**
    If the breach is likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the organization must also notify affected individuals "without undue delay." This notification should be clear and concise, explaining the breach, its impact, and the steps individuals can take to protect themselves.

- **Step 4: Ongoing Communication with the CNIL**
    After the initial notification, organizations are required to maintain ongoing communication with the CNIL as more information becomes available or as new developments occur. The CNIL may request further updates or recommend additional corrective measures to ensure the breach is properly handled.

#### 2. Notification Process to the FTC (United States)

In the U.S., the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** oversees data protection and privacy, ensuring that companies implement reasonable security measures and notify consumers and authorities when breaches occur.

- **Step 1: Identifying and Assessing the Breach**
    The organization must quickly determine the nature of the breach, the data involved, and the potential risk of harm to consumers. If personal data such as Social Security numbers, financial information, or health data is involved, notification to the FTC may be required. Organizations must also check if other federal or state regulations, such as **HIPAA** or state-level data breach laws, apply.

- **Step 2: Notification to the FTC**
    Depending on the nature of the breach, businesses may be required to notify the FTC under specific rules, such as the **Health Breach Notification Rule** or **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act**. If the breach involves personal health records, the organization must notify both the FTC and affected individuals. The notification should include:

    - Description of the breach
    - Type of data compromised
    - Number of individuals affected
    - Steps taken to mitigate the breach
    - Contact information for further inquiries.

- **Step 3: Coordination with Law Enforcement and Other Agencies**
    Along with notifying the FTC, organizations must also notify local law enforcement, such as the police, **FBI**, or **Secret Service**, depending on the breach’s nature. Businesses should consult with law enforcement before informing consumers to avoid interfering with any ongoing investigation.

- **Step 4: Notify Affected Consumers**
    Consumers must be informed promptly if their personal information has been compromised. The notification should clearly outline the breach, its impact, and steps consumers can take, such as placing fraud alerts or freezing credit reports. The FTC recommends offering identity theft protection services, especially if sensitive financial information has been compromised.

- **Step 5: Continuous Reporting**
    After the initial notification, businesses should remain in touch with the FTC and other authorities, providing updates as more information becomes available.

#### 3. Notification Process to Other Data Protection Authorities (Globally)

In addition to the CNIL and FTC, many other countries have data protection authorities that oversee the notification process following a data breach. Below is an overview of key jurisdictions:

- **United Kingdom (ICO)**: The **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)** requires organizations to notify breaches under the **UK GDPR**. Notifications must occur within 72 hours of discovering a breach, following similar guidelines to the CNIL. If the breach affects individuals' rights, affected parties must be informed directly.

- **Germany (BfDI)**: The **Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)** requires organizations to notify them within 72 hours of a breach. The organization must provide details about the breach, including the impact on individuals, corrective actions taken, and any legal consequences.

- **Australia (OAIC)**: The **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)** governs breach notifications under the **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme**. Businesses must notify affected individuals and the OAIC if a breach is likely to result in serious harm to individuals.

#### Practical Advice for Effective Notification

Effective notification involves clear and concise communication. Organizations should prepare detailed incident reports that include all necessary information without overwhelming the authorities with unnecessary details. Using a structured format can help ensure that all relevant information is included.

It is also important to designate a point of contact within the organization who can handle communications with the authorities. This person should be knowledgeable about the incident and the organization’s response efforts, ensuring consistent and accurate information is provided.

Maintaining detailed records of all communications with authorities is crucial. These records support compliance efforts and can be useful in future audits or investigations.

By understanding and adhering to legal and regulatory obligations, organizations can ensure that they handle security incidents appropriately, maintain compliance, and protect their reputation.
