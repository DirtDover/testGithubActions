# Introduction to Reverse Engineering

## Reverse Engineering Concepts and Objectives

Reverse engineering, also known as backward engineering or back engineering, is the process of deconstructing an existing device, system, or software to understand its design, architecture, components, and functionality. This method involves working backward from the final product to uncover the original design and development methods used. It is commonly applied in various fields such as mechanical engineering, software development, electronics, and more. It holds significant importance across multiple domains for several reasons:

**Understanding and Maintenance**: Reverse engineering provides a comprehensive understanding of a system's internal mechanisms. This is crucial for software maintenance and improvement. For instance, developers can analyze legacy code to fix bugs, enhance features, or patch security vulnerabilities, ensuring continued functionality and relevance of the software.

**Cost Reduction**: By examining existing systems, developers can repurpose components or technologies rather than creating new ones from scratch. This approach is particularly beneficial in software development, where modifying existing code or integrating pre-built modules can significantly reduce development time and costs.

**Training and Skill Development**: Reverse engineering offers practical experience with design patterns and system architectures. For IT professionals and engineers, this hands-on learning helps in honing problem-solving skills, understanding complex systems, and making informed decisions during troubleshooting and development.

**Security Analysis**: Analyzing systems or software for security vulnerabilities is a critical application of reverse engineering. By dissecting and understanding how malicious software, such as malware or ransomware, operates, security experts can uncover hidden vulnerabilities, develop effective countermeasures, and enhance overall system security.

**Innovation and Improvement**: Reverse engineering allows engineers to study competitor products and technologies, leading to innovation. This process helps in identifying areas for improvement and creating new or enhanced versions of products that are more efficient or better suited to market needs.

**Interoperability**: Ensuring that new software or systems can work with existing technologies is crucial. Reverse engineering helps in creating products that are compatible with other systems, enhancing interoperability, and improving user experience. This is especially important in integrating new solutions into diverse technology environments.

**Recovery of Lost Information**: When design documentation or source code is lost, reverse engineering can recover this critical information. This is essential for maintaining legacy systems, updating outdated technologies, and ensuring continuity in operations where original documentation is no longer available.

**Ransomware Analysis**: This process is vital for understanding how ransomware operates, including its encryption methods, propagation techniques, and command-and-control mechanisms. By analyzing ransomware, security experts can develop decryption tools, enhance detection methods, and improve incident response strategies. Additionally, insights from ransomware analysis help in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities that ransomware exploits, ultimately strengthening defenses against future attacks.

### Objectives and Applications in Cybersecurity

Reverse engineering serves several critical objectives within the realm of cybersecurity, addressing both software and hardware components to ensure robust defenses and enhance overall security posture.

A primary objective of reverse engineering in cybersecurity is **vulnerability identification**. By deconstructing software and hardware, security experts can uncover weaknesses and potential entry points for attackers. This involves examining the code, architecture, and implementation details to detect flaws that could be exploited. For instance, reverse engineers might use disassembly to convert machine code back into assembly language, providing a low-level view of the program's operations. Decompilation can then translate this into a higher-level language, making it easier to understand the logic and identify vulnerabilities.

Reverse engineering is also pivotal in **malware analysis**. When new malware is discovered, reverse engineers dissect it to understand its behavior, propagation methods, and payload. Techniques such as dynamic analysis, which involves running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its actions, and static analysis, which examines the code without execution, are employed to gain comprehensive insights. By understanding how malware operates, security teams can develop signatures for detection, create patches, and implement strategies to mitigate the threat.

Another significant application is in **software assurance and improvement**. Legacy systems often contain outdated code that might not adhere to current security standards. Reverse engineering these systems allows security professionals to understand their functionality and dependencies, making it possible to modernize and secure them. This process can reveal hidden bugs, security loopholes, and inefficient code segments that can be optimized or rewritten to enhance performance and security.

**Protocol analysis** is another area where reverse engineering is essential. Many network protocols, especially proprietary ones, are not well-documented. By reverse-engineering these protocols, security experts can understand how data is transmitted and identify weaknesses that could be exploited for attacks like man-in-the-middle or data injection. This understanding is crucial for developing secure communication channels and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit.

Moreover, reverse engineering plays a vital role in **intellectual property protection** and **compliance**. Companies reverse-engineer their own products to ensure that they do not inadvertently violate patents or industry standards. This process helps in verifying that the products adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, avoiding potential litigation and ensuring market acceptance. Additionally, by examining competitors' products, companies can safeguard their innovations and take legal action if intellectual property rights are infringed.

### Ethical and Legal Considerations

While reverse engineering is a valuable and often legal practice, it can lead to ethical and legal issues, particularly concerning intellectual property rights. Unauthorized reverse engineering for the purpose of copying or creating counterfeit products is illegal and can result in significant legal consequences. However, many jurisdictions allow reverse engineering for purposes such as interoperability, security research, and educational use, balancing the need for innovation with the protection of intellectual property.

## Types of Malware

Malware, short for *malicious software*, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or network. It encompasses a variety of harmful programs, each with specific behaviors and objectives, such as stealing data, damaging systems, or gaining unauthorized access to networks.. Here are the main types of malware:

### Virus

A virus is a malicious program that attaches itself to a legitimate file or program and replicates when executed. For example, [ILOVEYOU](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cybersecurity-history-iloveyou/45001) (2000) spread via email with an attachment named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs." When opened, it replicated and sent copies of itself to the user's contacts, causing billions of dollars in damages.

### Worms

Worms are standalone programs that spread rapidly through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities. [WannaCry](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/wannacry-history-lessons/45234) (2017) is a famous example that exploited a vulnerability in Windows to spread quickly, encrypting users' files and demanding a ransom for decryption, affecting hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide. It is officially considered as a "cryptoworm ransomware".

### Rogue Security Software

These programs pose as legitimate security tools but are malicious. [Antivirus 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_security_software) pretended to detect nonexistent threats to trick users into purchasing a full version. Once installed, it could also install other malware or steal personal information.

![Rogue](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D04-Reverse_Engineering/01-lectures/Rogue.png)

## Basic Static Techniques

There are three steps for reverse engineering a program. The first, 'Static' method, consists of analyzing the program on the basis of what is visible without executing it. This means above all analyzing the code and all the additional files that make it up. The second part, 'Dynamic' method, consists of analyzing it when it is running. You can also add a complementary steps by analyzing network traffic for getting more information on how does the program interact with other programs or machines.

![Reverse_Engineering_Steps](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D04-Reverse_Engineering/01-lectures/Reverse_Engineering_Steps.png)

We'll start by looking in detail at the different static analysis techniques. This method is instrumental in understanding the software's functionality, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and gaining insights into its design.

### File Analysis

File analysis begins by examining the file format, structure, and metadata of the software. This includes inspecting file headers to determine the file type, architecture, and entry points. File headers provide essential information about the executable format, target architecture, and sometimes even the operating system for which the software was intended.

Strings extracted from the binary can offer human-readable text such as error messages, URLs, or command-line options embedded within the code, which can provide clues about the software's functionality and behavior. Entropy analysis measures the randomness in the file, helping to detect packed or encrypted sections that might indicate obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious code.

### Disassembly

Disassembly involves converting machine code back into assembly language, providing a low-level view of the program's instructions. Key aspects of disassembly include instruction analysis, which helps understand the sequence of operations performed by the program. Control flow graphs (CFGs) visualize the flow of execution through the program's functions, making it easier to track the program's logic. Function identification involves recognizing and labeling functions within the code, which aids in understanding the software's modular structure.

### Decompilation

Decompilation attempts to convert machine code into a higher-level language, such as C or C++, making it easier to comprehend. Although decompilers do not always produce perfect code, they provide a more readable representation that helps in understanding the program's logic and data structures. This can also aid in identifying common algorithms and patterns used in the code, providing insights into the software's overall design and functionality.

### Symbol Analysis

Symbol analysis involves examining symbol tables, which are crucial for understanding and navigating compiled binaries. A symbol table is a data structure used by compilers and linkers to keep track of symbols names that represent functions, variables, and other identifiers in the code. These symbols are used during the linking process to associate names with their corresponding memory locations or code addresses.

**Symbol Tables**: A symbol table typically includes:

- **Function Names**: These symbols represent the entry points of functions and can be used to identify where specific functionalities are implemented in the binary.
- **Variable Names**: These symbols correspond to variables used within the code, helping to locate where data is stored and how it is accessed.
- **Debugging Information**: If available, debugging symbols provide additional context such as data types, source code line numbers, and scope information. This metadata is invaluable for reverse engineering and debugging, as it offers insights into the structure and logic of the code.

![SymbolTable](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D04-Reverse_Engineering/01-lectures/SymbolTable.png)

**Symbol Resolution**: This process maps symbolic names (like function or variable names) to their corresponding memory addresses or code locations within the binary. Symbol resolution is essential for understanding how different parts of a program interact and for tracing the flow of execution.

### Control Flow Analysis

Control flow analysis focuses on understanding the paths that the program can take during execution. This involves identifying basic blocks, which are sequences of instructions with a single entry and exit point. Control flow graphs (CFGs) represent the possible paths of execution between basic blocks, providing a visual map of the program's execution flow. Loop detection identifies loops and their conditions, which are critical for understanding the program's iterative processes and potential infinite loops or recursive calls.

### Data Flow Analysis

Data flow analysis tracks the flow of data through the program to understand how variables and memory locations are used. This includes variable tracking, which follows the usage and modification of variables, and taint analysis, which identifies how data from untrusted sources propagates through the program. Dependency analysis helps in understanding dependencies between different parts of the code, which is crucial for identifying how changes in one part of the program might affect other parts.

### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching involves searching for known patterns or signatures within the code. This technique is used to identify standard library functions, common algorithms, and, importantly, known malware patterns. By recognizing these patterns through function signatures and behavioral traits, analysts can detect malicious behavior more efficiently.

For example, tools like Mimikatz, which are designed to extract credentials from Windows systems, can be detected using pattern matching. Mimikatz has well-known code patterns and function signatures associated with its operation, such as functions for interacting with Windows security features or manipulating memory. Security systems and antivirus software use these distinctive patterns to identify the presence of Mimikatz or similar tools in the system. By matching these specific patterns, analysts can quickly pinpoint the use of such tools and address potential security threats.

### Hex Editing

Hex editing involves directly manipulating the binary data of a file at the byte level. This technique is particularly valuable for analyzing and modifying software binaries by inspecting and altering the raw hexadecimal representation of the data.

**Understanding Changes**: Hex editing is useful for examining changes made by patches or updates. By comparing the binary before and after a patch, analysts can understand what modifications were introduced, whether they fix vulnerabilities, change functionality, or enhance performance.

**Detailed Inspection and Modification**: Manual inspection of specific sections of the binary can provide detailed insights into the code's structure and functionality. For instance, by analyzing the binary, one can uncover how different segments of code interact, how data is processed, and where specific features are implemented.

**Unlocking New Features**: Sometimes, hex editing can reveal or unlock hidden functionalities within software. Developers may include unused or experimental features that are not enabled by default. By modifying certain bytes in the binary, analysts can activate these hidden features or adjust configurations to test their behavior. This can be particularly useful for exploring undocumented capabilities or customizing software beyond its standard functionality.

### Resource Analysis

Resource analysis focuses on examining non-code elements embedded within a binary, such as images, icons, configuration files, and embedded strings. These resources are often included in a binary to support its functionality, user interface, or configuration.

**Types of Resources**: Non-code resources can include:

- **Images and Icons**: Graphics used in the user interface of the software, such as icons and buttons. These resources can provide clues about the software's branding, user experience, and graphical elements.
- **Configuration Files**: Embedded files that contain settings or parameters used by the software to configure its behavior or appearance. Analyzing these files can reveal how the software is customized or how it interacts with other components.
- **Embedded Strings**: Textual data embedded within the binary, which might include error messages, status updates, or other user-facing text. Examining these strings can provide insights into the software's functionality and behavior.

**Tools and Techniques**: Tools like [Resource Hacker](https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) are used to extract and view these embedded resources. Resource Hacker allows analysts to open and manipulate the resource sections of a binary, making it easier to examine and modify non-code elements.

**Providing Context**: Analyzing these resources helps in understanding how the software is configured and customized. For example, configuration files might reveal default settings or hidden options, while embedded strings could expose internal messages or documentation. This context can be crucial for understanding the software’s intended use, detecting customizations, or identifying undocumented features.

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis for his part involves examining the behavior of a program while it is running. This method complements static analysis by providing insights into the program's runtime behavior, interactions, and potential vulnerabilities.

### Sandboxing

Sandboxing involves running the program in a controlled and isolated environment to observe its behavior without risking the host system. Tools like [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox) , [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) and [Any.Run](https://any.run/) automate the process, providing secure environments to analyze malware. Through sandboxing, analysts can monitor file system changes, observe network activity, and detect attempts to modify system settings, all within a safe and controlled environment.

### Debugging

Debugging involves a detailed examination of a program by executing it under the control of a debugger. This process enables reverse engineers to closely monitor and analyze the program's behavior, step through its execution, and inspect the values of variables and registers.

**Breakpoints**: A fundamental feature of debugging is the use of breakpoints. A breakpoint is a marker set in the code at a specific location where the execution of the program will pause or "break." When the program reaches a breakpoint, it stops executing, allowing the debugger to take control. This pause provides an opportunity to:

- **Inspect Variable Values**: Examine the current state of variables and registers at the point of interruption.
- **Analyze Program Flow**: Observe the sequence of executed instructions leading up to the breakpoint and understand how different parts of the code interact.
- **Evaluate Function Calls**: Track which functions are called and how they are executed, including the arguments passed and the return values received.

**Why Use Breakpoints**: Breakpoints are used to gain deeper insights into the program's execution by allowing developers to:

- **Identify Issues**: Locate and troubleshoot bugs by stopping execution at specific points where problems are suspected.
- **Understand Behavior**: Analyze how the program processes data and interacts with system resources at various stages of execution.
- **Verify Code Paths**: Ensure that code paths and conditional logic are functioning as intended by observing the program's behavior in real-time.

### Process Monitoring

Process monitoring tracks the activities of a running program, including process creation, file access, and registry modifications. Tools like [Process Monitor (ProcMon)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) and [Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) provide comprehensive views of these activities. Process monitoring helps in identifying which files and registry keys the program accesses or modifies, observing process creation and termination events, and tracking network connections, thereby offering a detailed understanding of the program's operational behavior.

![ProcessMonitoring](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D04-Reverse_Engineering/01-lectures/ProcessMonitoring.png)

### Memory Analysis

Memory analysis examines the contents of a program's memory while it is running. As you seen yesterday, tools like [Rekall](https://github.com/google/rekall) are instrumental in this process. Memory analysis helps in extracting hidden or encrypted data, analyzing the runtime state of the program, and detecting injected code or malicious payloads. This technique is vital for uncovering information that may not be visible through other analysis methods.

### Behavioral Analysis

Behavioral analysis focuses on understanding the overall behavior of a program during its execution. This involves observing how the program interacts with the system and other applications. Behavioral analysis is essential for identifying patterns of malicious behavior, detecting attempts to evade detection through anti-debugging techniques, and understanding the program's impact on system performance and stability.

### Code Injection and Hooking

Code injection and hooking involve inserting custom code into a running program to alter its behavior or intercept specific functions. Tools like Frida and Detours enable these techniques. Code injection and hooking help analysts analyze specific code paths, intercept and modify function calls, and bypass anti-debugging mechanisms, providing deeper insights into the program's operations and potential vulnerabilities.

### Emulation

Emulation runs the program in an emulated environment, allowing analysts to observe its behavior in a controlled and repeatable setting. Tools like [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/) can emulate different hardware and software configurations. Emulation is particularly useful for analyzing malware that targets specific hardware or OS versions, observing behavior in a safe environment, and detecting time-based or environment-specific triggers that might not be apparent in a live system.

## Basic Network Analysis

Network analysis in reverse engineering involves examining the network behavior of a program to understand its communication patterns, data exchanges, and potential vulnerabilities. This analysis provides valuable insights into how a program interacts with external systems and can reveal hidden functionalities or malicious activities.

### Network Traffic Monitoring

Network traffic monitoring captures and analyzes the data exchanged between a program and external entities. Tools like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and [Tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) are commonly used for this purpose. By monitoring network traffic, analysts can observe the types of data being transmitted, identify communication endpoints, and detect unusual or suspicious network activities. This helps in understanding the program's network behavior, identifying potential data exfiltration attempts, and analyzing interactions with remote servers.

### Protocol Analysis

Protocol analysis involves examining the specific network protocols used by a program to communicate. This includes analyzing the structure and content of the protocol messages and understanding how the program adheres to or deviates from standard protocol implementations. Tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) can be used to intercept and inspect protocol-specific data. By analyzing protocols, reverse engineers can uncover proprietary or custom protocols, identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and understand the data format and exchange mechanisms.

### Traffic Manipulation

Traffic manipulation involves altering network data to test how a program responds to modified or malicious inputs. Tools like [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/) and [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) are used to craft and inject custom network packets. This technique helps in assessing the program's robustness against malformed or unexpected data, identifying potential input validation issues, and testing for vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.

### Endpoint Analysis

Endpoint analysis focuses on identifying and examining the external servers and services a program communicates with. This includes resolving domain names, analyzing IP addresses, and understanding the nature of the connections. Tools like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) can be used to scan and gather information about the program's network endpoints. By analyzing endpoints, reverse engineers can detect hidden or malicious servers, understand the program's network dependencies, and identify potential targets for further investigation.

### Session Analysis

Session analysis involves examining the state and data of active network sessions between the program and its external entities. Tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and [Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) can capture and analyze session data. This analysis helps in understanding the session management mechanisms, detecting session hijacking or fixation vulnerabilities, and uncovering sensitive information transmitted during the session.

### API Call Monitoring

API call monitoring intercepts and logs API calls made by a program to the operating system. Tools like [API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) and [Sysinternals' Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) facilitate this process. By monitoring API calls, analysts can understand the interaction between the program and the OS, detect suspicious or malicious API calls, and analyze the sequence of API calls to infer the program's behavior and intentions.
