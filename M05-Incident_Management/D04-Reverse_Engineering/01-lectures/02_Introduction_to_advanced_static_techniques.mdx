# Introduction to Advanced Static Techniques

## Disassembly Techniques

In the context of reverse engineering, disassembly involves converting machine code into assembly code, enabling engineers to understand and analyze the internal workings of software. Various disassemblers facilitate this process by transforming machine code into human-readable assembly language. Among the most popular tools are IDA Pro, Ghidra, and objdump. [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) is a highly powerful interactive disassembler that supports numerous processor architectures. [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), an open-source reverse engineering framework developed by the NSA, offers both disassembly and decompilation capabilities. [objdump](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/objdump.1.html), part of the GNU suite, is another tool capable of disassembling binary files.

### Symbolic and Interactive Disassembly

Some disassemblers can use symbolic information (such as function and variable names) to make assembly code more readable. This information can come from symbol files (such as PDB files for Windows programs). Interactive disassembly tools, for their part, allow engineers to mark and annotate disassembled code, track function calls, and easily navigate between different parts of the program.

### Techniques for Bypassing Disassemblers

Bypassing techniques make code analysis and reverse engineering significantly more complex. Here is a detailed overview of two major techniques: obfuscation and self-modifying code, as well as strategies to overcome them.

#### Detection and Decryption of Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a protection method where code is modified to obscure its logic, making analysis more challenging. Obfuscators use several approaches to achieve this goal. Common techniques include renaming symbols, introducing redundant or misleading code, and creating obscure control structures.

To detect and decrypt obfuscation, a thorough analysis is required. An effective approach is to use static analysis tools to examine patterns and structures in the code, which can reveal signs of obfuscation. These tools can identify anomalies and recurring patterns typical of obfuscation.

In parallel, dynamic analysis allows for real-time observation of the code's behavior. This can help understand how different parts of the obfuscated code interact and function. When the code is encrypted or encoded, it is essential to decrypt this data to access the actual executable code. This step often involves extracting decryption routines and executing them to reveal the hidden code.

#### Analysis of Self-Modifying Code

Self-modifying code is a technique where the code changes during program execution, complicating disassembly. When a program uses self-modifying code, the version of the code visible in a disassembler may not reflect the code actually executed.

To analyze self-modifying code, the use of dynamic debuggers is crucial. Debuggers allow for real-time tracking of the program's execution, observing memory changes, and studying how and when the code is modified. By setting breakpoints and monitoring changes, one can understand the dynamics of these modifications.

Another effective method is instrumentation, where tracing code is added to monitor changes made to the code during execution. This approach helps analyze the effects of modifications on the program. Finally, analyzing the routines responsible for code modifications is also important. By examining these routines, one can understand how they alter the code and how this affects the overall execution flow.

## Decompilation Techniques

Decompilation is the process of transforming binary code or bytecode into a high-level programming language. This is particularly useful in reverse engineering to understand the logic and internal workings of software when the source code is not available. Decompilers are software tools that perform this transformation, converting machine code or bytecode into high-level source code. Some popular decompilers include [JD-GUI](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui) specifically designed for Java .class files, [Procyon](https://github.com/ststeiger/procyon) effectively handles new features of the Java language, [CFR](https://www.benf.org/other/cfr/) focuses on the readability of the decompiled code, and [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) in addition to its disassembly capabilities, provides decompilation functionalities for multiple architectures.

### Reconstruction of Code Structure and Handling Obfuscation

Decompilers aim to reconstruct the original structure of source code, including functions, classes, and control structures such as loops and conditions. This process involves identifying function entry points and their boundaries, as well as recognizing loops, conditions, and other control structures to translate them into high-level constructs.

Software may also be obfuscated to make decompilation more challenging. Advanced decompilers incorporate techniques to manage obfuscation effectively. These include deobfuscation methods to reverse the effects of obfuscation, such as restoring variable and function names, and data flow analysis to track the flow of data through the program, thereby understanding transformations and manipulations.

### Symbolic and Interactive decompilation

Some decompilations may use symbolic information if available, such as function and variable names, to improve the readability of the decompiled code. Interactive decompilation tools allow engineers to navigate through decompiled code, add annotations, and track function calls.

### Bypassing Anti-Decompilation Measures

Bypassing anti-decompilation measures is crucial for analyzing software designed to resist such efforts. These measures often involve code injection and encryption. Here’s a closer look at how these challenges are addressed.

#### Detection and Removal of Superfluous Code

To avoid decompilation, developers may inject superfluous or deceptive code into their software. This can include fictitious instructions and dead code. **Fictitious instructions** are operations that do not impact the program’s outcome but are intended to obfuscate the code. For instance, inserting irrelevant arithmetic operations or redundant function calls can make it more difficult to discern the actual purpose of the code. Similarly, **dead code** refers to sections of the code that do not execute or contribute to the program’s functionality, yet are included to create confusion. This might involve code paths that are never reached due to unsatisfied conditions.

Reverse engineering engineers use several strategies to address these issues. They start with **code analysis and simplification**, employing tools to map out all code paths. By **examining control flow graphs and data flow**, they can differentiate between functional and non-functional code. **Static analysis**, which involves inspecting the code without executing it, helps identify suspicious patterns or anomalies, while **dynamic analysis**, which involves running the software in a controlled environment, allows for the observation of the program’s behavior and the determination of which parts of the code are active. After identifying unnecessary or deceptive code, engineers can remove it through a process known as **code stripping**. This simplification helps focus on the core functionality of the software without altering its intended behavior.

#### Decrypting the Code

Encryption is a common technique used to protect code by making it unreadable or non-executable directly. To bypass encryption, engineers follow a series of steps. Initially, they need to identify the encryption mechanisms in use. This often involves analyzing the binary to locate decryption routines and key management mechanisms. Common encryption techniques include symmetric algorithms, such as AES and DES, and asymmetric algorithms like RSA.

The next step involves extracting encryption keys, which are often stored or generated at runtime. Engineers may use techniques such as memory dumps or tracking key generation functions to obtain these keys, which are essential for decrypting the code. During execution, encrypted code is decrypted and executed. Engineers utilize dynamic analysis techniques, such as debugging and execution flow monitoring, to capture the decrypted code at runtime. Tools like dynamic binary instrumentation, for example, DynamoRIO, can interface with decryption routines and record decrypted instructions.

In some cases, engineers may need to reverse the encryption algorithm itself, especially if it is customized or obfuscated. This process involves understanding how the encryption transforms the code and applying the reverse process to recover the original instructions. Advanced techniques, such as environment emulation, allow engineers to simulate the execution environment to observe how the encrypted code is decrypted and executed.

## What is IDA Pro?

![IDA_PRO](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D04-Reverse_Engineering/01-lectures/IDA_Pro.png)

IDA Pro, or _Interactive Disassembler_, is a widely-used commercial interactive disassembler in the field of reverse engineering. Initially created by Ilfak Guilfanov and now developed by Hex-Rays, IDA Pro allows for the conversion of binary code into assembly code, facilitating the analysis and understanding of compiled programs without access to the source code. Its main features are:

- **Interactive Disassembly**: IDA Pro allows users to navigate through the obtained assembly code, annotate it, and enhance it. Users can explore the code, add comments, and rename functions and variables for better comprehension.

- **Debugging**: In addition to disassembly, IDA Pro includes debugging features for multiple architectures. This allows users to trace program execution, inspect registers and memory, and set breakpoints.

- **Decompilation**: The commercial version includes a decompiler that converts assembly code into high-level source code, making analysis even easier. This provides a more readable and understandable view of the code.

- **Multi-Architecture Support**: IDA Pro supports numerous processor architectures, making it highly versatile. It can disassemble binaries for architectures such as x86, ARM, MIPS, and many others.

- **Automatic Analysis**: IDA Pro features automatic analysis algorithms that can identify functions, code blocks, function calls, and more, helping to structure the disassembly.

- **Scripting and Plugins**: IDA Pro supports scripting (notably in Python) and plugins, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks and extend the tool's functionality.

## How to use it?

To effectively use IDA Pro, follow these steps:

First, prepare your environment. Ensure you have a secure workspace, particularly if analyzing malicious software. Utilize virtual machines or isolated environments to prevent potential infections. Next, load the sample by opening the binary file you wish to analyze in IDA Pro. The software will automatically begin disassembling the code.

Navigate and annotate the code using IDA Pro's interactive features. You can add comments and rename functions and variables to better understand the program's operation. If the binary is executable, use the debugger to step through the code, observe registers and memory, and identify any suspicious behaviors.

Finally, if you have access to the commercial version of IDA Pro, decompile the code. This feature converts assembly code into high-level source code, greatly simplifying the analysis process.

IDA Pro offers several significant advantages. It provides a deep understanding of a program's internal workings, which is crucial for reverse engineering. Security researchers use IDA Pro to detect vulnerabilities in software by analyzing binary code. Additionally, security analysts employ IDA Pro to disassemble and analyze malicious software, understand its functionality, and develop countermeasures. It is also valuable for recovering features from legacy software with lost source code, enabling maintenance or modernization of these programs.

## Recognizing C Code

Knowledge of the C language is essential for reverse engineering, as it is widely used in operating systems, embedded software and mission-critical applications. C offers direct control over memory management and pointer usage, which is crucial for understanding security vulnerabilities. In addition, a solid understanding of C makes it easier to analyse binaries and use debugging and disassembly tools, enabling engineers to navigate machine code more efficiently and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Recognizing C code constructs involves identifying various elements and structures within a C program. Below is a detailed guide on how to recognize and understand these constructs:

## Variables

Variables in C are named storage locations in memory that hold data. They are declared with a specific data type, such as `int`, `float`, `char`, etc. They can be global, local, static, or automatic, depending on their scope and lifetime.

#### Syntax:

```c
type variableName;
```

#### Example:

```c
int a = 10;
float b = 20.5;
char c = 'A';
```

## Arithmetic

Arithmetic operations in C involve using operators to perform mathematical calculations. These operations follow a hierarchy of precedence, similar to standard mathematical rules.

#### Operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`

#### Example:

```c
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int sum = a + b; // sum = 15
```

## If Statement

The `if` statement is a control structure that executes a block of code based on a condition. It can be extended with `else if` and `else` for multiple conditions.

#### Syntax:

```c
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

#### Example:

```c
int a = 5;
if (a > 0) {
    printf("a is positive");
}
```

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. They are essential for tasks that require repetition.

#### Types of Loops:

- **For Loop:** Executes a block of code a specific number of times.

  ```c
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      printf("%d\n", i);
  }
  ```

- **While Loop:** Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

  ```c
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 10) {
      printf("%d\n", i);
      i++;
  }
  ```

- **Do-While Loop:** Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats as long as a condition is true.
  ```c
  int i = 0;
  do {
      printf("%d\n", i);
      i++;
  } while (i < 10);
  ```

## Function Call

A function call invokes a function to perform a specific task. It can return values and take parameters to operate on.

#### Syntax:

```c
functionName(arguments);
```

#### Example:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10);
    printf("%d", result); // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

## Switch

The `switch` statement is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of a variable. It is an alternative to multiple `if-else` statements.

#### Syntax:

```c
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression == value2
        break;
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
```

#### Example:

```c
int day = 3;
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day");
}
```

## Arrays

An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow efficient storage and access of multiple values using indices.

#### Syntax:

```c
type arrayName[size];
```

#### Example:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

## Structs

A `struct` is a user-defined data type that groups related variables of different types. They are used to create complex data types that represent real-world entities.

#### Syntax:

```c
struct StructName {
    type1 member1;
    type2 member2;
    // more members
};
```

#### Example:

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

struct Person person1;
person1.age = 30;
```

## Linked List

A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. It allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion of elements.

#### Node Definition:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```

#### Example:

```c
struct Node* head = NULL;
struct Node* second = NULL;
struct Node* third = NULL;

head = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
second = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
third = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

head->data = 1;
head->next = second;

second->data = 2;
second->next = third;

third->data = 3;
third->next = NULL;
```
