# Linux Artifacts

We have already seen the need to perform forensics on Windows workstations. Nevertheless, many Linux systems may be present in your network architecture. We're talking here mainly about servers that can host databases, websites, etc., and which may therefore be storing sensitive data.

## Operating System

The first source of artefect on linux and on any operating system is the information coming from itself.

### User Accounts

One of the first places to look in any investigation is the users and accounts that have logged in or used a system. We’ve added a user accounts artifact to pull data from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to quickly identify any user accounts or service accounts on the local machine.

You’ll get common details such as username, ID, group ID, home directory, password last change date/time, hash, etc…

```
# Identify potentially active user accounts
cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep sh
cat /etc/passwd | grep dash

# Sort user accounts by their UID to detect anomalies
sort -nk3 -t: /etc/passwd

# Find files belonging to non-existent users (indicators of unauthorized access)
find / -nouser -print

# Extract password hashes for forensic analysis
cat /etc/shadow

# Examine group information for user privilege analysis
cat /etc/group

# Review sudo configuration for potential privilege escalation
cat /etc/sudoers

# Check for additional sudo configurations for backdoors
cat /etc/sudoers.d/*

# Review recently used files for user activity
cat /home/$USER/.recently-used.xbel
```

Here is a small script which automate all of these test directly :

```
echo "=== Active User Accounts (bash/sh/dash) ==="; grep -E 'bash|sh|dash' /etc/passwd; \
echo "=== Sorted User Accounts by UID ==="; sort -nk3 -t: /etc/passwd; \
echo "=== Files Belonging to Non-existent Users ==="; find / -nouser -print; \
echo "=== Password Hashes ==="; cat /etc/shadow; \
echo "=== Group Information ==="; cat /etc/group; \
echo "=== Sudo Configuration ==="; cat /etc/sudoers; \
echo "=== Additional Sudo Configurations ==="; cat /etc/sudoers.d/*; \
echo "=== Recently Used Files ==="; cat /home/$USER/.recently-used.xbel
```

### SSH Keys, SSH Known Hosts and Authorized Keys

You can also check everything about SSH. We now have three new artifacts to help identify SSH activity on a system for Linux, but it will also work for Windows and Mac systems as well because they are structured very similarly across operating systems.

- Identify any public and/or private keys found on the system
- identify any users have connected to the system using SSH keys if you’re investigating the SSH server itself (public keys will get stored in the authorized_keys file)
- any systems the local user might have connected to if an entry was made in the local known_hosts file

```
# Investigate SSH authentication keys for potential unauthorized access
cat /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Analyze SSH known hosts for suspicious connections
cat /home/$USER/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Logon activities

Then, we proceed to review the logon activities of the compromised host. There are many files and logs that can be used to retrieve this information. Here are a few commands to try out:

```
# Check users who are currently logged in
w

# Last login information for all users. It reads the /var/log/lastlog file
lastlog
cat /var/log/lastlog

# List of last logged in users and their login times
last -f /var/log/wtmp

# Failed login attempts
last -f /var/log/btmp

# Searching for login activities in auth.log with specific keyword
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i user
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i Accepted
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i failed
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep i "login:session"

# CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) of auth.log
cat /var/log/secure
```

Here is an automated script for all of these informations :

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Currently Logged In Users ==="
w
echo ""

echo "=== Last Login Information (lastlog) ==="
lastlog
echo ""

echo "=== Last Login Records from /var/log/lastlog ==="
cat /var/log/lastlog
echo ""

echo "=== List of Last Logged In Users and Times (/var/log/wtmp) ==="
last -f /var/log/wtmp
echo ""

echo "=== Failed Login Attempts (/var/log/btmp) ==="
last -f /var/log/btmp
echo ""

echo "=== Searching Auth.log for Login Activities ==="
echo "  - User-related entries (excluding cron and sudo)"
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i user
echo ""

echo "  - Accepted Login Entries"
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i Accepted
echo ""

echo "  - Failed Login Entries"
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i failed
echo ""

echo "  - Session Login Events"
grep -v cron /var/log/auth.log* | grep -v sudo | grep -i "login:session"
echo ""

echo "=== CentOS/RHEL Secure Log (/var/log/secure) ==="
cat /var/log/secure
echo ""

echo "=== Script Finished ==="
```

### System Logs

The center to any good investigation around the activity on a system centers around the logs available. Event logs with Windows, unified logs with Mac, and syslog for Linux. There are a lot of log files for a given system and almost every application generates logs in Linux, but most investigations start with the syslog.

Most Linux logs are stored under **/var/log/**. When working with log files, it is advised that an analyst should have a lead of what to look for and search for related events in log files. A full review of logs is possible but tedious and time-consuming due to a large number of logs. For forensics purpose, we recommand you to spend more time on the following logs:

- **_/var/log/auth.log_** (/var/log/secure in RHEL/CentOS): This log contains all authentication events and Cron job session events (e.g. start, close etc.) for Debian. This may be the most important log to analyze.
- **/var/log/deamon.log**: records events generated by background daemons. Usually, background processes/services offer invaluable logs to a user’s activities.
- **_/var/log/syslog_** (/var/log/messages in RHEL/CentOS): contains general system messages. Particularly, it also contains cron job execution with its associated commands.

You can also automating all this parsing by using tools like [MasterParser](https://github.com/securityjoes/MasterParser) enabling scans on supported logs, such as auth.log for example, extract critical details including SSH logins, user creations, event names, IP addresses and much more.

```bash
python3 MasterParser.py --file /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Access.log

You can also check on services logs such as `access.log`. Here is an exemple for apache2:

```
192.168.0.164 - - [15/Mar/2024:08:33:33 +0000] "GET /wordpress/wp-admin/css/forms.min.css?ver=6.4.3 HTTP/1.1" 200 6874 "http://192.168.0.172/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

- `192.168.0.164` = IP address of the client (remote host) that made the request to the server
- `[15/Mar/2024:08:33:33 +0000]` = Date and time when the request was received
- `GET /wordpress/wp-admin/css/forms.min.css?ver=6.4.3 HTTP/1.1` = HTTP Request
- `200` = HTTP status code
- `6874` = Response Size
- `http://192.168.0.172/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php` = Web page that referred the client to the requested URL
- `Mozilla/5.0 …` = User-Agent

There is also a tool for this named [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/) to briefly and visualy analyze access.log on terminal or with your browser.

On terminal:
![GoAccess_Terminal](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D03-Incident_Response_and_Forensics_Analysis/01-lectures/goaccess_terminal.png)

On browser:
![GoAccess_Dashboard](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D03-Incident_Response_and_Forensics_Analysis/01-lectures/goaccess_dashboard.png)

### Bash History

Bash history can be quite helpful to trace back the actions of a user if they’re using the command line. Bash history is another artifact very similar on both Linux and Mac systems. It will report the shell commands sent by each user. Unfortunately, there are no times associated to each command, but they will be in the same order as executed by the user. Also, of note for anyone doing analysis of a live system, the bash history file gets written on close so any open terminals won’t have a history file until the terminal is closed (however it is in memory).

```
# Check command history
history

# Check all files with "history" in their name in the user's home directory
cat /home/$USER/.*_history

# Check the command history (specific to bash shell)
cat /home/$USER/.bash_history

# Check the command history for the root user (specific to bash shell)
cat /root/.bash_history

# Check the MySQL command history for the root user
cat /root/.mysql_history

# Check the FTP command history
cat /home/$USER/.ftp_history

# Check the SFTP command history
cat /home/$USER/.sftp_history

# Check the VIM editor history
cat /home/$USER/.viminfo

# Check the history of commands entered in the 'less' pager
cat /home/$USER/.lesshst
```

## Process

In addition to examining system-wide information, forensic analysis often involves scrutinizing individual processes to uncover anomalies or malicious activities. This can be done through various commands and tools that provide insights into processes and their behavior.

### Reviewing Running Processes

To get an overview of all running processes and their details, you can use several commands:

- **`htop`**: This interactive process viewer provides a real-time, colorful display of running processes. It allows you to see process names, their IDs (PIDs), CPU and memory usage, and their hierarchical relationships. Use the arrow keys to navigate and get more details on each process. This tool is particularly useful for a live system to get a high-level view of process activity.

- **`ps -aux`**: This command lists all running processes along with their full command lines, user IDs, and other details. The `-a` option shows processes for all users, `-u` displays user-oriented output, and `-x` includes processes not attached to a terminal. For example:

```bash
ps -aux
```

This output includes columns such as PID, user, CPU and memory usage, and the full command used to start the process. Reviewing the command lines can help identify suspicious or unexpected processes.

- **`lsof -p <PID>`**: This command lists all open files associated with a specific process ID (PID). It is useful for understanding what resources a process is using. For example:

```bash
lsof -p 1234
```

This will list all files opened by the process with PID 1234, including network connections, files, and directories. It can reveal if a process is accessing unusual or unauthorized files.

- **`pstree -a`**: This command shows the process hierarchy in a tree format, including the command line arguments. The `-a` option displays the command line arguments for each process. For example:

```bash
pstree -a
```

This output helps in understanding the relationship between processes and their parent-child relationships, making it easier to identify processes spawned by suspicious activities.

### Forensic Analysis with Volatility

While live process examination provides valuable insights, deeper analysis often requires examining memory dumps. `Volatility` is a powerful tool for this purpose. Here’s how to use `Volatility` to analyze processes in a Linux environment:

1. **Obtain a Memory Dump**: Before using `Volatility`, you need a memory dump of the system. This can be done using tools like `LiME` (Linux Memory Extractor) or `fmem`:

```bash
lime -d /dev/sda1 -o /path/to/memory.dump
```

This command captures a memory dump from the specified device.

2. **Analyze the Memory Dump**: Use `Volatility` to analyze the memory dump. You need to specify the profile corresponding to the Linux distribution and version. For example, to list processes from a memory dump:

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/memory.dump --profile=LinuxUbuntu1804x64 linux_pslist
```

- **`-f /path/to/memory.dump`**: Specifies the path to the memory dump file.
- **`--profile=LinuxUbuntu1804x64`**: Indicates the profile for the Linux distribution and kernel version. This profile helps `Volatility` interpret the memory structures correctly.
- **`linux_pslist`**: The command to list all processes in the memory dump.

This command extracts information about running processes at the time of the memory capture, including process IDs, parent process IDs, command lines, and memory usage.

3. **Inspect Other Process Details**: You can use additional `Volatility` plugins to investigate other aspects of processes, such as open files, network connections, and more.

### Recover deleted process’s binary

After exploiting, attackers will want to remove their traces, starting by deleting the various scripts used. We can still find them using different techniques. This method attempts to recover the binary executable from the process’s memory by extracting a portion of the memory associated with the process. Of course, in order to use this method successfully, you will first need to retrieve the process PID. In the case of an attack in progress, you can take a screenshot of the available processes. If one of them disappears, you can still recover it by following this procedure:

```
# Start by consulting the memory of the process
cd /proc/[PID]/

# maps contains memory maps of the process, showing the memory regions used by the process
head -1 maps

# Extract memory content (1000 bytes) at specified ADDRESS to tmp directory
dd if=mem bs=1 skip=ADDRESS count=1000 of=/tmp/recovered_proc_file
```

<Note type="tip" title="My title">

The Process ID folder in `/proc` contains many files which can also help us in our analysis. Here is a table listing the usefulness of each file:

| File/Directory in /proc/PID | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cmdline                     | Command-line arguments passed to the process                                     |
| cwd                         | Symbolic link to the current working directory of the process                    |
| exe                         | Symbolic link to the executable file of the process                              |
| fd                          | Directory containing symbolic links to open file descriptors used by the process |
| status                      | Various status information about the process                                     |
| mem                         | Represents the process’s memory space                                            |
| cpuinfo                     | CPU-related information for the process                                          |
| maps                        | Memory maps of the process                                                       |
| limits                      | Resource limits imposed on the process                                           |
| io                          | I/O statistics for the process                                                   |
| stat                        | Various statistics about the process                                             |
| sched                       | Scheduling information for the process                                           |
| syscall                     | Information about system calls made by the process                               |
| oom_score                   | OOM (Out-Of-Memory) score of the process                                         |

</Note>

#### Cron tasks

**Cron Jobs** (Files in /etc/cron.\*) and user-specific cron jobs (crontab -l) show scheduled tasks, which can reveal automated or planned actions on the system. Knowing what tasks and services being run can be quite valuable in many investigations and even more importantly for incident response or intrusion cases where malware will often use scheduled tasks or cron jobs to maintain persistence on a system.
For Identifying any scheduled tasks or suspicious activities that may have been configured to execute at specific times you can use the following command:

```
# View the configuration of the cron service managed by systemd
cat /lib/systemd/system/cron.service

# View the cron tasks scheduled for a specific user
crontab –u <user> -l

# View the system-wide crontab file containing system cron tasks
cat /etc/crontab

# Check all files in /etc/cron
tail -f /etc/cron.*/*

# List all user-specific cron files in the cron spool directory
ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs/*

# View the contents of the atjobs file, which contains at jobs scheduled by the at command
cat /var/spool/cron/atjobs
```

You can also look for scheduled task on these files/directories:

- /var/spool/cron/crontabs/\*
- /var/spool/cron/atjobs
- /var/spool/anacron
- /etc/cron\*
- /etc/at\*
- /etc/anacrontab
- /etc/incron.d/\*
- /var/spool/incron/\*

#### Services and systemd

Don't forget to examine systemd configurations and unit files on the system to identify any modifications or suspicious configurations that may have been made to services or startup processes.

```
# List enabled services and Check their associated start commands
for service in $(systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep enabled | awk '{print $1}'); do echo "Service: $service"; systemctl cat $service | grep ExecStart= | sed 's/^/Command: /'; echo "--------------------------------------------------"; done
```

Or by listing the different `systemd` directories:

- /lib/systemd/system/
- /lib/systemd/system-generators/\*
- /lib/systemd/user/
- /etc/systemd/system/
- /etc/systemd/user-generators/
- /usr/local/lib/systemd/user-generators/
- /usr/lib/systemd/user-generators/

### Infected binaries

You should also check for recently modified files that may indicate unauthorized activity or compromise. Attacker can compromise current legit binaries and implement a persistent backdoor inside which can allow them to fly under the radar of regular scanner or IR Teams.

```
# Find binaries modified within the last 10 days in specified directories
find /lib /usr/bin /usr/sbin -type f -newermt "$(date -d '10 days ago' +'%Y-%m-%d')"
```

#### Login Shell

Examining login shell configurations and scripts responsible for system initialization and startup processes can help to add a better understanding of potential pivoting done.

```
# Check system-wide Bash initialization file
cat /etc/bash.bashrc

# Check user-specific Bash initialization file
cat /home/$USER/.bashrc

# Check user-specific Bash profile file
cat /home/$USER/.bash_profile

# Check system-wide profile file
cat /etc/profile

# Check scripts in the /etc/profile.d directory
cat /etc/profile.d/*

# Check user-specific profile file
cat /home/$USER/.profile

# Check user-specific Bash login file
cat /home/$USER/.bash_login

# Check user-specific Bash logout file
cat /home/$USER/.bash_logout

# Check system-wide Bash logout file
cat /etc/.bash_logout
```

You should also look at SSH daemon and related resource files

```
# View the SSH service configuration managed by systemd
cat /lib/systemd/system/ssh.service

# View the SSH daemon configuration file
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# List any user-specific SSH resource files in the ~/.ssh directory
ls ~/.ssh/rc

# List system-wide SSH resource files in the /etc/ssh directory
ls /etc/ssh/sshrc
```

For an automatic approach of this, you can use several tools such as [Linux-CatScale](https://labs.withsecure.com/tools/cat-scale-linux-incident-response-collection) which stands for "Compromise Assessments at Scale" and was developed during several incident response and compromise assessment engagements to collect forensic artefacts from various Linux environments.

![Cat_Scale](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D03-Incident_Response_and_Forensics_Analysis/01-lectures/Cat_Scale.png)

#### MOTD & RC

We can also analyse start-up processes such as **RC scripts** responsible for system initialization and startup processes.

```
# Review rc scripts
cat /etc/rc*
```

Or **motd** which stands for “message of the day”. These scripts may contain important system status updates, notifications, or potentially malicious content inserted by attackers.

```
# Examine the scripts responsible for generating dynamic messages displayed to users upon login
cat /etc/update-motd.d/*
```

## Network

The second principal part to investigate in, is **Network**. Firstly analyzing any malicious connection and unexpected IP address can help discovering more information of the action.

```
#  List all TCP and UDP connections on your system along with their respective listening and non-listening sockets
netstat -antup

# kernel routing table
netstat -rn
route

# Check static DNS lookups
cat /etc/hosts
```

## Kernel

The Linux kernel is the central component of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources, processes, and hardware interactions. In forensic investigations, a deep understanding of kernel behavior can reveal critical evidence of system compromise or tampering.

### Threads

Kernel threads in Linux are specialized threads managed by the kernel. Unlike user-space processes, kernel threads are listed with brackets in process listings. These threads perform critical functions within the kernel and lack command line arguments.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To view kernel threads:

```bash
ps aux | grep '\['
```

- `ps aux` lists all processes running on the system, including kernel threads.
- `grep '\['` filters the output to show only those lines containing kernel threads, which are denoted by brackets (e.g., `[kthreadd]`).

For a hierarchical view of processes:

```bash
pstree -p
```

- `pstree -p` displays the process tree with process IDs, showing the relationship between user-space processes and kernel threads. This hierarchical view helps identify how kernel threads interact with other processes.

### Modules

Kernel modules are pieces of code that extend the kernel’s functionality at runtime without needing a reboot. Investigating these modules helps ensure that no unauthorized or malicious modules are active.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To list currently loaded kernel modules:

```bash
lsmod | head -n 5
```

- `lsmod` lists all loaded kernel modules.
- `head -n 5` limits the output to the first 5 lines, giving a quick overview of the most active modules.

To get detailed information about a specific module:

```bash
modinfo $(lsmod | awk 'NR==2{print $1}')
```

- `lsmod | awk 'NR==2{print $1}'` extracts the name of the second module listed by `lsmod`.
- `modinfo <module_name>` displays detailed information about the module, such as its description, author, license, and dependencies.

[kmod](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/lsmod.html) offers more advanced management options:

```bash
kmod list
kmod info <module_name>
```

- `kmod list` provides a comprehensive list of loaded kernel modules, similar to `lsmod` but with more detailed information.
- `kmod info <module_name>` shows detailed information about a specified module, including its version and any kernel-specific details.

### Parameters and Version

Kernel parameters influence system behavior at startup, while tunable parameters can be adjusted during runtime. Checking the kernel version helps detect unauthorized changes.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To view kernel boot parameters:

```bash
cat /proc/cmdline
```

- `cat /proc/cmdline` displays the kernel parameters used during boot. This includes parameters that configure kernel behavior and options passed by the bootloader.

To view dynamic kernel parameters:

```bash
sysctl -a | grep kernel
```

- `sysctl -a` lists all current kernel parameters and their values.
- `grep kernel` filters this list to show parameters related to kernel configuration, which can be useful for identifying any modifications.

[procinfo](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/procinfo.8.html) provides a summary of kernel information:

```bash
procinfo
```

- `procinfo` outputs a detailed summary of system information, including kernel version, memory usage, and load averages. This command provides an overview of kernel and system statistics.

### Memory and Logs

Kernel memory and logs provide valuable information about the kernel’s operation and any potential issues. Analyzing kernel memory can reveal hidden data or anomalies, while logs capture system messages and errors.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To access kernel memory:

```bash
cat /proc/kcore
```

- `cat /proc/kcore` displays a representation of the kernel’s memory. This file shows the physical memory of the system but is typically large and complex, requiring careful analysis.

[Volatility](https://volatilityfoundation.org/) helps analyze memory dumps:

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/memory.dump --profile=LinuxUbuntu1804x64 linux_pslist
```

- `-f /path/to/memory.dump` specifies the path to the memory dump file.
- `--profile=LinuxUbuntu1804x64` sets the profile for the memory dump, indicating the version and distribution of Linux.
- `linux_pslist` lists processes from the memory dump, providing insights into running processes and their states.

[journalctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/journalctl/) provides a structured view of kernel logs:

```bash
journalctl -k -b
```

- `-k` filters the logs to show only kernel messages.
- `-b` restricts the logs to messages from the current boot, which helps in analyzing recent kernel activity.

### System Calls and Hooks

System calls are the interface through which user-space applications interact with the kernel. Monitoring these calls can help detect unauthorized or malicious activities.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To trace system calls made by a specific process:

```bash
strace -c -p $(pgrep sshd)
```

- `strace -c` traces system calls and counts the number of each type.
- `-p $(pgrep sshd)` attaches `strace` to the process with the name `sshd`, identified by `pgrep sshd`, to monitor its system calls.

[SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) provides advanced instrumentation for real-time tracing:

```bash
stap -e 'probe kernel.function("sys_open") {printf("%s(%d) open %s\n", execname(), pid(), argstr)}'
```

- `-e` specifies the script to execute.
- `probe kernel.function("sys_open")` sets up a probe on the `sys_open` function, which is called when files are opened.
- `printf("%s(%d) open %s\n", execname(), pid(), argstr)` formats the output to show the executable name, process ID, and file path being opened.

### Hidden Processes and Rootkit Artifacts

Rootkits often hide their presence by manipulating kernel data structures or processes. Detecting these hidden elements is crucial for uncovering malicious activities.

**Forensic Analysis Example:**

To find hidden processes:

```bash
ps aux | grep -v 'PID'
cat /proc/<PID>/status
```

- `ps aux | grep -v 'PID'` lists all processes except those containing the specified PID, helping to identify processes that might not show up in a standard process listing.
- `cat /proc/<PID>/status` provides detailed status information about a specific process, which can help verify its legitimacy.

[rkhunter](https://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/) scans for rootkits and exploits:

```bash
sudo rkhunter --check
```

- `sudo` runs the command with root privileges.
- `--check` performs a scan for rootkits, backdoors, and local exploits.

[chkrootkit](http://chkrootkit.org/) is another tool for rootkit detection:

```bash
sudo chkrootkit
```

- `sudo` runs the command with root privileges.
- `chkrootkit` scans the system for known rootkits and provides a report of any potential findings.

### Timers and Deferred Tasks

Kernel timers and workqueues manage scheduled and background tasks. Analyzing these can provide insights into kernel scheduling behavior.

To view active timers:

```bash
cat /proc/timer_list | grep -A 5 "Timer List"
```

- `cat /proc/timer_list` displays information about all active timers in the kernel.
- `grep -A 5 "Timer List"` filters and shows the section of the output related to the timer list, providing details on active timers.

[ftrace](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/ftrace.html) allows advanced tracing of kernel functions:

```bash
echo function_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
```

- `echo function_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer` sets the tracing method to function graph, which records function calls and their relationships.
- `cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace` displays the trace output, showing detailed information about function calls and execution flow.

### Sockets and Integrity

Kernel-level network sockets facilitate system communication and can be analyzed for unauthorized activity. Ensuring kernel file integrity is crucial for system security.

To review active network connections:

```bash
ss -tuln
```

- `ss` is a utility to investigate socket connections.
- `-t` displays TCP sockets.
- `-u` shows UDP sockets.
- `-l` lists listening sockets
- `-n` displays numerical addresses and ports, avoiding DNS resolution.

[AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)](https://aide.github.io/) checks file integrity:

```bash
sudo aide --check
```

- `sudo` runs the command with root privileges.
- `aide --check` compares the current state of the files against the database to detect unauthorized changes.

## File Systems

Analyzing the file system architecture is essential in forensic investigations because it provides a comprehensive view of how data is organized, stored, and accessed on a computer. This analysis helps identify hidden or suspicious files, uncover traces of deleted data, and understand the timeline of file creation, modification, and access. By examining file system structures, investigators can detect anomalies, recover critical evidence, and reconstruct events leading up to a security incident, ultimately aiding in the accurate attribution of malicious activities and the formulation of effective countermeasures.

### Hunting unusual files

Files deliberately created to maintain access for attackers are of course intended to remain hidden and present within the system. Research by the incident response team into these different files can sometimes be complex, especially on a system with a complex file architecture. That's why you shouldn't forget to use a few Linux commands that can be a great help.

```
# Search for files modified within the last 5 days and Check them for further inspection, change 5 if needed
find / -type f -mtime -5 | less
```

You can even search for different files or executables that may have been converted into vulnerabilities using SUID or SGID bit:

```
# Find files owned by root with the setuid or setgid permissions and print their paths
find / -user root -perm -04000 -print
```

#### Webshell

The main access point to a system can be found in a web server. Web pentesting being the most widely recognised and studied, attacks multiply at this level and it is one of the most important places to analyse. That's why it's important to analyse the content of the web folder as well as the server configurations in order to detect any potential traces or vulnerabilities that could have been the cause of all this.

```
# Search for PHP files in the /var/www/html directory and print their modification timestamps
find /var/www/html -type f -name "*.php" -printf "%T@ %f\n" | sort -n | awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", $1), $2}'

# Monitor Apache configuration files
tail -f /etc/apache2/*/*

# Or Nginx
tail -f /etc/nginx/*/*
```

You can also check on history and downloaded file from WebBrowser:

```
# List Mozilla Firefox profiles, check history and downloads
ls /home/$USER/.mozilla/firefox

# For Google Chrome
ls /home/$USER/.config/google-chrome
```

### Trash

And simply, you should also check in the trash. Contrary to what you might imagine, it is sometimes possible to find files that the user has deleted but which have not actually been completely removed from the system. These files can be of real value as part of a forensic analysis. Most examiners are quite familiar with the value data found in the trash or recycle bin artifacts. Luckily, the Linux trash artifact is very similar to what can be found in the Mac trash and for the most part we’re looking for two sources of data, the file itself and any metadata associated to it. Find both the original file and any metadata associated to it (such as deletion date, etc…) but occasionally one of the two sources are missing, and you’ll be left with partial results.

You can also use **PhotoRec** which search for file signatures and recover deleted files from disk images.

```bash
photorec disk_image.dd
```

Or **TestDisk** which can recover lost partitions and repair corrupted partition tables, making it indispensable for forensic recovery in case of disk corruption.

```bash
testdisk /dev/sda
```

## Rootkits

A **rootkit** is a type of malicious software designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or network while hiding its presence. Rootkits can modify the operating system, libraries, or applications to conceal their activities and maintain long-term access. In forensic investigations, rootkits are challenging because they hide evidence of unauthorized actions, making it difficult to detect and analyze the breach.

### Investigate loaded kernel modules

For that you can start investigating kernel modules. These modules have deep access to the core functions of the operating system, allowing them to control system processes and interact with hardware at a fundamental level. Malicious kernel modules can hide their presence and other malware, making detection challenging. They can also maintain control over the system even after reboots, leading to long-term security breaches and potential data loss. Understanding and analyzing kernel modules helps investigators uncover hidden threats, assess the extent of a compromise, and develop effective remediation strategies.

```
jedha@training:~$ lsmod

snd_timer              40960  1 snd_pcm
```

1. The first column lists the module names (tls, lime, etc.).
2. The second column shows the size of each module.
3. The third column (Used by) indicates which other modules are using the listed module.

To identify whether a loaded kernel module or its dependencies are part of a rootkit or not, we may want to try this methods:

- Compare the list of loaded kernel modules (lsmod output) against a known good baseline.
- Look for modules that have suspicious names, sizes, or descriptions.
- Investigate the modules listed under the “Used by” column.
- Research any unfamiliar or suspicious modules online.

To get detailed information about a specific module:

```
modinfo <name of module>
```

Review configuration files that control module loading.

```
tail -f /etc/modprobe.d/*
```

### Automated Tools

As you can see its particularly difficult to find Rootkits manually this is why you should regularly check for their presence using dedicated rootkit detection tools.

The first tools is named [chkrootkit](https://www.chkrootkit.org/). It is a free software application licensed under the GNU GPL that can be used to detect whether a UNIX system has been compromised by a rootkit. It detects traces of an attack and checks for the presence of a rootkit on a Unix/Linux system by checking the following points:

- whether any executable files on the system have been modified ;
- whether the network card is in promiscuous mode;
- whether one or more LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) worms are present.

Similarly, [rkhunter](https://www.kali.org/tools/rkhunter/) scans systems for known and unknown rootkits, backdoors, sniffers and exploits.

```bash
rkhunter --check
```

It checks for:

- SHA256 hash changes;
- files commonly created by rootkits;
- executables with anomalous file permissions;
- suspicious strings in kernel modules;
- hidden files in system directories; and can optionally scan within files.

You can also run an antivirus/malware scan with the most popular anti-virus on Linux systems: [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/)

It provides a command-line interface for scanning your filesystem (files and directories) and also includes numerous tools for email filtering, automatic signature updates, and other functions. A lot of applications use ClamAV, mostly Internet gateways and mail servers, as a safety measure for scanning incoming communications and stopping malware distribution.
