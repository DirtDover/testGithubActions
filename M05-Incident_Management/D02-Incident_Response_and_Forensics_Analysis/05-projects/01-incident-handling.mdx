# Active Directory Forensics Investigation – IBC Subsidiary

## **Context**

As a consultant at **Correlia**, you have been asked to assist in a critical **cybersecurity investigation** at **IBC International**, a subsidiary of IBC Bank. A potential breach has been reported involving the workstation of an employee, where suspicious activity has raised concerns about a broader compromise within the network.

You have been provided with **log files** and **network captures** with various workstations and the **Domain Controller (DC)** to help identify the root cause of the incident. The **top management** of IBC International is particularly concerned about whether the breach has affected the **Active Directory (AD)** and compromised sensitive systems.

Your task is to conduct a forensic investigation to determine:

- The origin of the suspicious activity.
- Whether any **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement** has occurred within the network.
- The full extent of the attack and any potential damage to the AD environment.

Your findings will be used to inform **remediation efforts** and **security enhancements** to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## **Consultant’s Notes**

- **Target System**: **workstations** and **Active Directory**.
- **Suspicious Activity**: An employee noticed an unknown process on her machine and reported unusual system behavior.
- **Logs Provided**: Logs from workstations **Sysmon and Security events**, **Domain Controller logs**, and a **PCAP network capture** are available for analysis.
- **Objective**: Investigate the nature of the attack and assess whether the attacker has compromised the **Active Directory** or escalated privileges.

## **Task**

Your task is to investigate the attack and prepare a **PowerPoint presentation** for **top management** at IBC International. The presentation should:

1. **Summarize your investigation**: Explain how the attacker may have breached an employee workstation, escalated privileges, and potentially compromised the Active Directory.
2. **Highlight key findings**: Focus on evidence of malware execution, unauthorized privilege escalation (e.g., **Kerberoasting**), or Active Directory compromise (e.g., **DC Sync attack**).
3. **Propose high-level recommendations**: Provide clear and actionable steps for preventing similar incidents in the future, focusing on **security improvements** and **risk mitigation** strategies.

## **Deliverables**

Prepare a **PowerPoint report** that covers:

- **Incident Overview** – Briefly describe the incident and the scope of the investigation.
- **Key Findings** – Summarize the main points discovered during the investigation, including any malware execution, suspicious processes, and network traffic.
- **Privilege Escalation** – If applicable, highlight any signs of privilege escalation and how the attacker moved within the network.
- **Active Directory Compromise** – If applicable, explain the impact on the Active Directory and any potential data exfiltration or control gained by the attacker.
- **Recommendations** – Present high-level recommendations for **security improvements**, such as enhancing **phishing defenses**, improving **network segmentation**, and implementing stronger **logging and monitoring**.

### Presentation Tips

- Keep your slides **clear and concise**. The top management will not be technical experts, so avoid too much technical jargon.
- Focus on **key takeaways** and **business impact**. The goal is to communicate the severity of the attack and how it can be prevented in the future.
- Use **visual aids** like diagrams, timelines, and charts to make the data more accessible.

This exercise challenges you to not only investigate the attack but also to present your findings in a clear, non-technical way that is understandable for IBC International’s top management. The goal is to ensure that they understand the risks and take action to strengthen their security posture.
