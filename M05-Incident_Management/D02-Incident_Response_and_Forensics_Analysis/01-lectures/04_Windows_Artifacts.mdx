## Event Logs and Other Logs

**Windows event logs** record a wide range of system and application events, crucial for tracing activities and detecting suspicious behavior.

### User Accounts and Lateral Movement

Event logs related to user accounts provide details on **user logins**, **account creations**, and **deletions**. For instance, an unexpected new admin account might signal suspicious activity. Logs can also reveal attempts at **lateral movement** within the network, suggesting that an attacker is moving from one system to another to access more sensitive resources.

### Malicious Services and Malware Execution

Logs can identify **malicious services** by showing their creation, modification, and execution. For example, a service running with elevated privileges without a clear purpose may be suspicious. Logs of **software installations** can also reveal unauthorized applications, including malware. If an application is installed at an unusual time, it may indicate a security breach. Additionally, logs detailing **malware execution** provide information about malicious code, the user or process that executed it, and its impact on the system. For example, a malicious script running immediately after user login suggests that the user's computer might be compromised.

### Anti-Forensics Activities and Script Execution

Events related to **command-line and script execution** can shed light on user or automated process activities. Frequent use of these tools may indicate attempts to automate malicious tasks. Logs may also show attempts to **delete or alter log entries**, suggesting efforts to conceal evidence. For example, log deletions following suspicious activity may indicate attempts to hide an intrusion.

### Other Logs: In-Memory and Disk

**In-memory logs** include transient data present while the system is running, such as active processes, network connections, and system state information. Capturing and analyzing memory provides a snapshot of the system's state at a specific time. **Disk logs** are persistent logs stored on the hard drive, including system logs, application logs, and security logs, offering a long-term record of activities.

## Processes and Networking

The analysis of **running processes** reveals active programs, system tasks, and potentially malicious software. By examining process trees, investigators can understand process relationships and identify suspicious activities. For example, an unknown process with high resource usage might indicate hidden malware.

**Network artifacts** encompass network connections, traffic patterns, and communication endpoints. Analyzing network logs can detect signs of **unauthorized access**, **data exfiltration**, and other network-based attacks. For instance, unusual data transfers to external IP addresses might indicate data theft.

## Services, Drivers, Kernel, and GUI Subsystem

**Windows services** are background processes that typically run with elevated privileges. Analyzing these services can uncover both legitimate functions and malicious services installed by attackers. For example, a service that starts automatically and is not part of standard Windows services might be malware.

**Drivers** are low-level components interacting with hardware devices. Malicious drivers can provide persistent access to a system. Forensic analysis of drivers can identify unauthorized or malicious drivers. For instance, a driver that does not match known hardware could indicate a rootkit.

The Windows **kernel** manages system resources and hardware interactions. Analyzing kernel artifacts can reveal system modifications and rootkits operating at the kernel level. For instance, kernel memory modifications might suggest the presence of advanced persistent threats.

The **GUI subsystem** manages the graphical interface of Windows. Forensic analysis may include examining user interface artifacts such as opened windows, user interactions, and graphical session details. These artifacts help reconstruct user activities and identify suspicious behaviors. For example, analyzing recent document history or clipboard contents can provide insights into user actions.
