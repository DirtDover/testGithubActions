# Hunting Across the Enterprise

Forensic work mainly focuses on Windows systems because most workstations use Windows. However, it's also important to consider machines running other operating systems, like Linux, which are commonly used for various servers.

## Powershellock Holmes 🔍

When we speak about Windows Forensic, **PowerShell** emerges as a formidable tool, offering a wide array of cmdlets and scripts to aid investigators in retrieving and analyzing critical data from compromised systems.

### Command-line

**PowerShell** is a powerful tool that can significantly aid forensic investigations, offering numerous cmdlets to gather and analyze critical data from compromised systems. During a breach, it is crucial to retrieve detailed information to construct a timeline of the intrusion and identify how attackers gained access and what parts of the system they interacted with. PowerShell is deeply integrated into Windows operating systems and can manage applications such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Windows Server almost entirely through command-line operations.

For instance, **PowerShell**’s network-related cmdlets like `Get-NetTCPConnection` and `Get-NetRoute` allow investigators to view active TCP connections and IP routing information, helping to identify suspicious network activity. The `Get-Process` cmdlet provides detailed information about running processes, which can be pivotal in identifying malicious applications or unauthorized processes.

Moreover, it can access and analyze Windows Event Logs using cmdlets like `Get-EventLog` and `Get-WinEvent`, which retrieve logs from various system events, including security, application, and system logs. This is essential for understanding the actions taken by attackers on the system. The `Get-ADUser` and `Get-ADGroup` cmdlets help investigators examine user accounts and group memberships, revealing potential privilege escalations or unauthorized account creations.

**PowerShell** also enables checking startup processes with `Get-CIMInstance` to identify unusual or malicious services configured to run at system startup. Additionally, `Get-ChildItem` can be used to find recently modified files, potentially indicating tampered or newly created malicious files.

### Scripts Enable

**PowerShell** is not only a robust command-line tool for forensic investigations but also offers a plethora of scripts designed specifically for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). These scripts can streamline the process of gathering and analyzing evidence, making them indispensable for responding to cyber attacks on Windows devices.

One such script is the comprehensive [DFIR Script](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/DFIR-Script.ps1). This script automates the collection of a wide array of artifacts from the compromised system. It gathers information on local IP configurations, open network connections, startup processes, active users, installed software, running services, scheduled tasks, and much more. When run as an administrator, it can also collect detailed Windows Security Events, shadow copies, and PowerShell history from all users, providing a thorough snapshot of the system's state.

The **DFIR Script** not only collects this vital information but also structures the output into a neatly organized directory, which is then zipped for easy remote collection. This makes it highly practical for use in various scenarios, including integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s Live Response capabilities. By enabling Live Response and allowing unsigned script execution, analysts can remotely execute these scripts on compromised devices, collect the artifacts, and download them for detailed analysis. But there are also many other interesting scripts. Here are a few of them:

- [**CollectWindowsEvents**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/CollectWindowsEvents.ps1): This script simply collects all Windows event logs and exports them as CSV files.
- [**CollectPnPDevices**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/CollectPnPDevices.ps1): It collects information on all Plug and Play devices, such as USB drives and network adapters, which can be crucial for identifying unauthorized device connections.
- [**DumpLocalAdmins**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/DumpLocalAdmins.ps1): This script lists all local administrator accounts on a device, helping to identify potential privilege escalations.
- [**LastLogons**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/LastLogons.ps1): It lists the last successful logins, aiding in tracking user activity around the time of the incident.
- [**ListInstalledSecurityProducts**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/ListInstalledSecurityProducts.ps1) and [**ListDefenderExclusions**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/ListDefenderExclusions.ps1): These scripts list installed security products and their statuses, as well as any exclusions configured in Windows Defender, respectively. These can highlight potential weaknesses or overlooked security gaps.

Additionally, PowerShell scripts can export the collected data in CSV format, making it compatible with SIEM tools like Sentinel, Splunk, and Elastic. This allows for advanced filtering, aggregation, and visualization, enabling forensic analysts to derive actionable insights efficiently.
