# Hunting Across the Enterprise

Forensic work mainly focuses on Windows systems because most workstations use Windows. However, it's also important to consider machines running other operating systems, like Linux, which are commonly used for various servers.

## Powershellock Holmesüîç

When we speak about Windows Forensic, **PowerShell** emerges as a formidable tool, offering a wide array of cmdlets and scripts to aid investigators in retrieving and analyzing critical data from compromised systems.

### Command-line

**PowerShell** is a powerful tool that can significantly aid forensic investigations, offering numerous cmdlets to gather and analyze critical data from compromised systems. During a breach, it is crucial to retrieve detailed information to construct a timeline of the intrusion and identify how attackers gained access and what parts of the system they interacted with. PowerShell is deeply integrated into Windows operating systems and can manage applications such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Windows Server almost entirely through command-line operations.

For instance, **PowerShell**‚Äôs network-related cmdlets like `Get-NetTCPConnection` and `Get-NetRoute` allow investigators to view active TCP connections and IP routing information, helping to identify suspicious network activity. The `Get-Process` cmdlet provides detailed information about running processes, which can be pivotal in identifying malicious applications or unauthorized processes.

Moreover, it can access and analyze Windows Event Logs using cmdlets like `Get-EventLog` and `Get-WinEvent`, which retrieve logs from various system events, including security, application, and system logs. This is essential for understanding the actions taken by attackers on the system. The `Get-ADUser` and `Get-ADGroup` cmdlets help investigators examine user accounts and group memberships, revealing potential privilege escalations or unauthorized account creations.

**PowerShell** also enables checking startup processes with `Get-CIMInstance` to identify unusual or malicious services configured to run at system startup. Additionally, `Get-ChildItem` can be used to find recently modified files, potentially indicating tampered or newly created malicious files.

### Scripts Enable

**PowerShell** is not only a robust command-line tool for forensic investigations but also offers a plethora of scripts designed specifically for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). These scripts can streamline the process of gathering and analyzing evidence, making them indispensable for responding to cyber attacks on Windows devices.

One such script is the comprehensive [DFIR Script](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/DFIR-Script.ps1). This script automates the collection of a wide array of artifacts from the compromised system. It gathers information on local IP configurations, open network connections, startup processes, active users, installed software, running services, scheduled tasks, and much more. When run as an administrator, it can also collect detailed Windows Security Events, shadow copies, and PowerShell history from all users, providing a thorough snapshot of the system's state.

The **DFIR Script** not only collects this vital information but also structures the output into a neatly organized directory, which is then zipped for easy remote collection. This makes it highly practical for use in various scenarios, including integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint‚Äôs Live Response capabilities. By enabling Live Response and allowing unsigned script execution, analysts can remotely execute these scripts on compromised devices, collect the artifacts, and download them for detailed analysis. But there are also many other interesting scripts. Here are a few of them:

- [**CollectWindowsEvents**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/CollectWindowsEvents.ps1): This script simply collects all Windows event logs and exports them as CSV files.
- [**CollectPnPDevices**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/CollectPnPDevices.ps1): It collects information on all Plug and Play devices, such as USB drives and network adapters, which can be crucial for identifying unauthorized device connections.
- [**DumpLocalAdmins**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/DumpLocalAdmins.ps1): This script lists all local administrator accounts on a device, helping to identify potential privilege escalations.
- [**LastLogons**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/LastLogons.ps1): It lists the last successful logins, aiding in tracking user activity around the time of the incident.
- [**ListInstalledSecurityProducts**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/ListInstalledSecurityProducts.ps1) and [**ListDefenderExclusions**](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Incident-Response-Powershell/blob/main/Scripts/ListDefenderExclusions.ps1): These scripts list installed security products and their statuses, as well as any exclusions configured in Windows Defender, respectively. These can highlight potential weaknesses or overlooked security gaps.

Additionally, PowerShell scripts can export the collected data in CSV format, making it compatible with SIEM tools like Sentinel, Splunk, and Elastic. This allows for advanced filtering, aggregation, and visualization, enabling forensic analysts to derive actionable insights efficiently.

## Kansa and KAPE for Collecting & Analyzing Data

In addition to PowerShell, advanced forensic tools like **KANSA** and **KAPE** play a crucial role in collecting and analyzing data during a digital forensics investigation. These tools extend the capabilities of PowerShell by offering more specialized functionalities tailored for comprehensive data gathering and analysis, making them indispensable in the forensic toolkit.

#### KANSA

[**KANSA**](https://github.com/davehull/Kansa) is a modular framework that leverages PowerShell for scalable data collection and analysis across multiple Windows systems. It is designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple system information collection to complex malware hunting operations. KANSA‚Äôs modular architecture allows forensic analysts to customize their data collection processes according to the needs of their investigation.

It is highly scalable, capable of collecting data from numerous endpoints simultaneously, making it ideal for large-scale environments. Its modular design utilizes PowerShell scripts known as "modules" to perform specific tasks, enabling analysts to select which modules to run based on their investigative needs. The flexibility of KANSA allows it to gather diverse types of data, such as event logs, network information, running processes, and more, making it adaptable to various forensic scenarios. Additionally, the centralized management of data collected by KANSA facilitates easier analysis and correlation of information from multiple systems.

For example, a forensic analyst can use KANSA to collect event logs from multiple servers to identify suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts or unexpected service starts. By centralizing this data, the analyst can quickly identify patterns and correlations that indicate potential security incidents.

#### KAPE

[**KAPE**](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape) (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) is another powerful tool designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing forensic artifacts from Windows systems. KAPE focuses on being lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for rapid data collection in incident response scenarios.

KAPE utilizes targets, which are predefined configurations specifying which artifacts to collect from a system, such as browser history, registry keys, or event logs, and these targets can be customized to focus on specific data types. It includes modules that parse collected data into human-readable formats, simplifying the analysis of complex data structures. Designed for portability, KAPE can be run from a USB drive or other external media, enabling forensic analysts to quickly deploy it in various environments. Additionally, KAPE is optimized for speed, capable of collecting and processing large volumes of data in a short time, which is crucial during time-sensitive incident responses.

## Velociraptor digging deeper

![velociraptor](https://cyber-lead-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/M03-Incident_Management/D02-Incident_Response_and_Forensics_Analysis/01-lectures/velociraptor.png)

**Velociraptor** is a unique and advanced open-source platform designed for endpoint monitoring, digital forensics, and cyber response, developed by Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR) professionals to meet the need for a powerful and efficient tool capable of hunting for specific artifacts and monitoring activities across extensive fleets of endpoints. Unlike traditional DFIR tools such as KANSA and KAPE, Velociraptor provides a more streamlined and scalable approach to investigations and incident responses.

While **KANSA** and **KAPE** rely on pre-defined configurations and modules to collect and parse data, Velociraptor leverages the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) to create highly customized artifacts. This allows investigators to collect, query, and monitor almost any aspect of an endpoint, groups of endpoints, or an entire network directly at the source. This targeted approach reduces the need to gather all data centrally before analysis, which can be cumbersome and inefficient, especially in large-scale environments.

The ability to push queries to endpoints and parse artifacts directly on the endpoint itself sets Velociraptor apart from tools like KANSA and KAPE. For instance, instead of collecting and transferring extensive logs or memory images to a central server for post-processing, Velociraptor can run specific queries on endpoints to extract only the most relevant data. This not only speeds up the investigation process but also significantly reduces the amount of data transferred and processed, making it more practical for environments with thousands of endpoints.

Furthermore, Velociraptor's continuous monitoring capabilities enable forensic analysts to keep a vigilant watch over endpoint activities in real-time, allowing for the immediate detection of suspicious behaviors such as unauthorized file transfers to USB devices or network anomalies indicative of a malware outbreak. This proactive stance is crucial for timely incident response and mitigation, something that traditional tools might struggle to achieve due to their reliance on periodic data collection and processing cycles.
